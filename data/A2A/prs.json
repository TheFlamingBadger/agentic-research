Install dependencies: npm install\r\n2. Run code validation: node validate-optimizations.js\r\n3. Run core tests: npx ts-node tests/core-optimizations-test.ts\r\n4. Verify TypeScript compilation: npx tsc --noEmit\r\n\r\n## Optimization Achievements\r\n✅ Error Handling & Retry\r\n✅ Task Persistence & Recovery\r\n✅ Connection Pool & Resource Management\r\n",

    "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new optional fields to the `AgentSkill` model - `inputFields` and `outputFields` - allowing agents to define structured, named input and output fields with detailed type and schema information. These fields complement the existing `inputModes` and `outputModes`, which specify supported mime types.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, agent skills declare only `inputModes` and `outputModes` as lists of mime types. While this indicates supported data formats (e.g., `\"text/plain\"`, `\"image/png\"`), it does **not** convey the **structure or semantics** of the input/output data, such as named fields or their types. In some use cases, this makes it difficult for clients to:\r\n\r\n- Understand what specific inputs an agent expects or outputs it produces  \r\n- Properly validate, log, or debug message contents  \r\n- Create user interfaces with meaningful form fields to invoke an agent\r\n- Handle multiple fields of the same type in a structured way\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new optional layer by defining a `FieldDefinition` model, which lets agents declare:\r\n\r\n- Named input and output fields that are expected to be received and returned by a skill\r\n- Field kinds (`text`, `file`, `data`)  \r\n- Supported mime types for each field  \r\n- Optional JSON schemas for structured data fields  \r\n- Field descriptions and optionality flags  \r\n\r\nThe `AgentSkill` model is extended with two new optional lists: `inputFields` and `outputFields`. These provide a semantic, machine-readable description of the skill interface, while retaining backward compatibility by keeping `inputModes` and `outputModes`.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n- Enables clients to build more precise and user-friendly input forms  \r\n- Improves clarity and reduces ambiguity in message composition  \r\n- Facilitates validation, logging, and debugging with schema support  \r\n- Supports complex skills with multiple inputs/outputs of the same type  \r\n- Provides a semantic layer that builds upon existing mime type declarations\r\n\r\nCloses #813 \r\n\r\nIdea emerged from discussion in: #462 \r\n",

In this case, virtually no changes.\r\n- Adds lint exceptions for those lint rules that do not pass `buf lint`. This now ensures that `buf lint` passes.\r\n- Updates a few comments in `buf.yaml` for clarification.\r\n- Updates the `README.md` to use `buf lint` instead of `buf build`. Note that `buf build` is implicitly run via `buf lint`.\r\n- Removes the instruction about checking for breaking changes, as there's no mechanism for this set up yet. Happy to contribute a PR to make this simple if this would be desirable.\r\n- Removes the instruction to modify `buf.yaml`. `buf.yaml` should generally never need modification.",

AgentCards can declare supported extensions via `capabilities.extensions`. This declaration can include additional information via `capabilities.extensions.params`. Clients can use this as a basis for extension negotiation: if a client supports an extension that the server supports, the client can then follow the protocol defined by the extension. This can include, but is not specifically limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Requiring specific structure of messages, such as following a specific schema for a DataPart.\r\n2. Providing additional information in request/response Message and Artifact objects via their `metadata` field.\r\n3. Exposing additional methods beyond the core A2A protocol methods.\r\n\r\nMessages and Artifacts can now include an indication of which extensions are present in their content. I do not yet know if extension indications are necessary on other data structures (such as `MessageSendParams` or `TaskStatus`). I'd say extension indications are not strictly necessary at all: it's possible to infer that an extension was followed by inspecting the message content itself (are the metadata fields you expect present, does the DataPart follow the schema you expect, etc). However, they are useful for validation and simplifying extension implementation logic: \"you said you followed this extension, so I'll validate fields are present and then perform my processing\".\r\n\r\nFixes #585 ",

Schema Enhancement ([types.ts](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/))\r\nAdded [metadata](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) field to [TaskStatus](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) interface:\r\nNew optional property:\r\nThis enables agents and runtimes to attach arbitrary custom metadata to each task status update, supporting richer integrations and extensibility.\r\n2. Server Logic Alignment (a2aServer.ts)\r\nImplemented metadata merging for task status updates:\r\nWhen updating a task’s status, if metadata is present in the update, it is shallow-merged with any existing metadata on the task’s status.\r\n## Example logic:\r\nThis ensures that partial [metadata](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) updates do not overwrite existing keys unintentionally, and aligns runtime behavior with the new schema.\r\n## Motivation:\r\nThese changes bring TaskStatus in line with other extensible objects in the A2A schema, enabling agent runtimes to support custom, task-level [metadata](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) throughout the task lifecycle. The server logic ensures that metadata updates are handled in a non-destructive, composable way.\r\n\r\n## Impact:\r\n\r\nBackward compatible (the new field is optional).\r\nEnables richer agent-to-agent and client-to-agent integrations.\r\nNo breaking changes to existing consumers.\r\nLet me know if you need a sample PR description or further breakdown!\r\n- Extend TaskStatus interface to include an optional  field for custom task-level metadata.\r\n- Add/align server logic to merge TaskStatus.metadata on update, ensuring non-destructive extensibility.\r\n- Enables richer agent-to-agent and client-to-agent integrations and brings TaskStatus in line with other extensible objects in the A2A schema.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [ x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [ x] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [x ] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [x ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #275 🦕\r\n",

    "body": "# Description\r\n**Problem:**\r\nThe `A2AClient.send_task_streaming` method, while defined as an `async def` function and an asynchronous iterable, was internally using the synchronous `httpx.Client` and the synchronous `connect_sse` with `event_source.iter_sse()`. This caused blocking behavior when the method was awaiting network I/O for Server-Sent Events (SSE), effectively stalling the asyncio event loop from which it was called. This could prevent other asyncio tasks from running concurrently and lead to performance degradation or unexpected delays in applications relying on non-blocking operations.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nThis change refactors `send_task_streaming` to utilize `httpx.AsyncClient` along with the asynchronous `aconnect_sse` context manager and `event_source.aiter_sse()` for iterating over SSE events.\r\n\r\nThese modifications ensure that all network I/O operations within `send_task_streaming` are performed asynchronously, allowing the asyncio event loop to switch to other tasks while awaiting responses. This makes the method truly non-blocking and suitable for use in high-concurrency asyncio applications.\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n- Replaced `httpx.Client` with `httpx.AsyncClient` within `send_task_streaming`.\r\n- Replaced `connect_sse` with `aconnect_sse` for establishing the SSE connection asynchronously.\r\n- Changed the SSE iteration from `for sse in event_source.iter_sse()` to `async for sse in event_source.aiter_sse()`.\r\n\r\nThis ensures the client behaves as expected in an asynchronous environment, improving responsiveness and concurrency.\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [ ] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #<issue_number_goes_here> 🦕\r\n",

    "body": "### Problem\r\nClients need to follow up or refine previously created tasks by agents.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n**Option 1: Restartable Tasks**  \r\n\r\nAgents allow tasks to restart processing from terminal states (Completed, Failed and Cancelled).\r\n\r\nThis option focuses on reusing existing tasks by restarting them when a follow-up or refinement is requested. This simplifies agent development by maintaining local context and referencing previous tasks directly. However, it introduces complexities with parallel follow-ups, task immutability, and bookkeeping. It can also lead to inconsistencies between the client and agent's view of task history and requires the agent to manage refined artifacts and inputs.\r\n\r\n**Option 2: New Task in same contextId (Preferred)**  \r\n\r\nContext can be thought of as a larger goal from a client perspective. Clients can use the same contextId from the previous task and send a message for refinement or followup. Agents should spawn up new tasks. Tasks cannot restart processing from terminal states (Completed, Failed and Cancelled).\r\n\r\nThis approach favors creating new tasks for each follow-up or refinement while using the same `contextId`. This simplifies implementation for agents, enables parallel processing, and maintains task immutability. Clients can keep references to tasks with their state, artifacts, and messages. However, agents need to implement a strategy to infer previous tasks based on the `contextId` and handle potential ambiguities.\r\n\r\n### Other Aspects\r\n**Task Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   **App-to-Agent:** Agents infer the previous task based on the `contextId`. They may use strategies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant tasks, messages, and artifacts.\r\n*   **Agent-to-Agent:** Clients can optionally provide `referenceTaskIds` in the Message object to explicitly reference previous tasks. This acts as a hint to the serving agent.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   Agents are expected to infer the relevant artifacts based on the referred tasks. Since agents possess a deeper understanding of the tasks they have created, they are better positioned to identify the appropriate artifact for a given user message.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity about which artifact should be used for the follow-up or refinement, the agent will ask for input using `input-required`. Clients can then pass on the artifact inputs as `Parts` in the message.\r\n*   To preserve explicit linkage between inputs and previously generated artifacts, clients can optionally populate `referenceArtifactId` in the `part`'s `metadata`.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Mutation Tracking**\r\n\r\n*   A follow-up or refinement task may lead to the modification of older artifacts and the generation of new ones. While tracking all mutations of an artifact might be useful, the client is best suited to determine what constitutes the \"latest\" or intended artifact to be refined. The client ultimately decides what the result is and can reject the mutation.\r\n*   Therefore, the serving agent can choose their methodology to maintain consistency in artifact identification. Eg. it can keep the **same artifact-name** when generating a refinement on the original artifact.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity or if the context is not sufficient, the agent will utilize `input-required` to explicitly request the client to specify which artifact to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed API Change\r\n\r\n*   Addition of optional `referenceTaskIds` field in the `Message` object.\r\n*   Optional addition of `referenceArtifactId` in `part` metadata of `Message` object.\r\n",

Tasks cannot restart processing from terminal states (Completed, Failed and Cancelled).\r\n\r\nThis approach favors creating new tasks for each follow-up or refinement while using the same `contextId`. This simplifies implementation for agents, enables parallel processing, and maintains task immutability. Clients can keep references to tasks with their state, artifacts, and messages. However, agents need to implement a strategy to infer previous tasks based on the `contextId` and handle potential ambiguities.\r\n\r\n### Other Aspects\r\n**Task Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   **App-to-Agent:** Agents infer the previous task based on the `contextId`. They may use strategies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant tasks, messages, and artifacts.\r\n*   **Agent-to-Agent:** Clients can optionally provide `referenceTaskIds` in the Message object to explicitly reference previous tasks. This acts as a hint to the serving agent.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   Agents are expected to infer the relevant artifacts based on the referred tasks. Since agents possess a deeper understanding of the tasks they have created, they are better positioned to identify the appropriate artifact for a given user message.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity about which artifact should be used for the follow-up or refinement, the agent will ask for input using `input-required`. Clients can then pass on the artifact inputs as `Parts` in the message.\r\n*   To preserve explicit linkage between inputs and previously generated artifacts, clients can optionally populate `referenceArtifactId` in the `part`'s `metadata`.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Mutation Tracking**\r\n\r\n*   A follow-up or refinement task may lead to the modification of older artifacts and the generation of new ones. While tracking all mutations of an artifact might be useful, the client is best suited to determine what constitutes the \"latest\" or intended artifact to be refined. The client ultimately decides what the result is and can reject the mutation.\r\n*   Therefore, the serving agent can choose their methodology to maintain consistency in artifact identification. Eg. it can keep the **same artifact-name** when generating a refinement on the original artifact.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity or if the context is not sufficient, the agent will utilize `input-required` to explicitly request the client to specify which artifact to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed API Change\r\n\r\n*   Addition of optional `referenceTaskIds` field in the `Message` object.\r\n*   Optional addition of `referenceArtifactId` in `part` metadata of `Message` object.\r\n",

    "body": "Add an optional \"extensions\" property to AgentCard for listing custom API extensions.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nIt is understandable that the A2A protocol specification attempts to be as generic as possible to accommodate many agent interaction use cases. However, by not defining a way of calling custom RPC methods that developers may decide to implement on their A2A servers (to address cases not covered by the specification), the A2A protocol puts some limitations on the agentic app developers.\r\n\r\nOf course, if necessary, additional APIs can always be deployed on separate endpoints (and it makes sense for scalability). However, some developers may like the simplicity of single-endpoint deployments for their smaller agentic apps.\r\n\r\nWhile anyone can take an A2A server library and manually add their custom methods, the lack of guiding definitions in the A2A spec means that extensions developed on such forked libraries are not easily shareable with the community. Furthermore, it would add the effort overhead required for maintaining a forked version of the server library.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional property to `AgentCard` to allow listing of custom API extensions.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\nHere are some use case examples:\r\n* Perform actions on multiple tasks.\r\n* Allow clients to adjust their data and artifact retention polices.\r\n* Payment-system integrations.\r\n* Out-of-band account actions, for example, subscription upgrade with the app provider.\r\n* Give the client the ability to adjust agent behavior when processing current and future task(s), e.g., edit context data.\r\n* Run domain-specific procedures on the server.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nAn extension entry only needs to specify the \"what\" (unique `id`, `methods`) and \"where\" (`prefix`), leaving other details up to the extension developers (also allowing them to add more details as metadata).\r\n\r\nSo, the schema for an extension entry is defined as follows:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport interface AgentExtension {\r\n  /** Unique identifier of the API extension. */\r\n  id: string;\r\n  /** Human-readable name of the API extension. */\r\n  name: string;\r\n  /** Description of the API extension. */\r\n  description?: string;\r\n  /**\r\n   * Prefix added in front of the extension's JSON-RPC methods. `prefix` SHOULD NOT start with\r\n   * \"message\" or \"tasks\". It is recommended to put all extensions under a common prefix, for\r\n   * example `extensions/first/`, `extensions/second/`.\r\n   * \r\n   * Examples:\r\n   * With `prefix=extensions/taskHistory/`, an API extension method listed as `clearRecent` would\r\n   * match an RPC method registered at `extensions/taskHistory/clearRecent` on the A2A server. This\r\n   * allows supplying multiple versions of an extension.\r\n   */\r\n  prefix: string;\r\n  /** The list of method names (without prefix) provided by the API extension. */\r\n  methods: string[];\r\n  /**\r\n   * Metadata can be used to supply API-extension-specific docs, request-response schemas, and\r\n   * other relevant information.\r\n   */\r\n  metadata?: {\r\n    [key: string]: any;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example: Custom Task History Management API\r\n\r\nFor example, an extension that adds history management methods can be listed as follows:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"extensions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"TaskHistMgr-v1\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Task History Manager\",\r\n      \"description\": \"The A2A extension for managing the task history.\",\r\n      \"methods\": [\r\n        \"clearAll\",\r\n        \"clearRecent\",\r\n        \"search\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"prefix\": \"extensions/taskHistory/\",\r\n      \"metadata\": {\r\n        \"links\": [\r\n          {\"name\": \"docs\", \"href\": \"https://example-com.github.io/docs\"}\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith such an extension installed, the client, after running some mock tasks (e.g., comparing different travel plans given by the travel agent), can clean up these tasks with:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": \"39\",\r\n  \"method\": \"extensions/taskHistory/clearRecent\",\r\n  \"params\": {\r\n    \"initiatedWithinLast\": \"1 hour\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Next Steps\r\n\r\nSince the added \"extensions\" property is optional, this is a non-breaking change to the current A2A protocol. The official SDK can be updated to support his feature at a later time.\r\n\r\nOther A2A server libraries **that wish to support this option** can implement a way of registering additional RPC methods (e.g., similar to how routes are registered in WSGI and ASGI apps). For convenience, the default option for registering an extension can be set to append it to AgentCard(s) automatically. This would help with the deployment consistency for such agentic apps as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [x] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #585 🦕\r\n",

The generated video is then uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and a signed URL for accessing the video is provided back to the client.\r\nCurrently, the Veo API does not provide real-time progress updates during video generation. To enhance user experience, this agent simulates progress updates while the video is being processed. \r\nAlso includes changes to the demo app to display the received video.

    "body": "The CLI now prompts the user to select multiple file paths to attach to a task message. Previously, it only supported attaching a single file. This enhancement allows users to provide more context to the agent by including multiple relevant files. Error handling for file not found and other read errors has also been added.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request updates the CLI tool located at `/samples/python/hosts/cli/__main__.py` to allow users to attach multiple files when sending a task message to an agent.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation only allowed selecting a single file. This change introduces a loop that repeatedly prompts the user for file paths until an empty input is provided, collecting all specified paths. Each file is then read, base64 encoded, and added to the `message['parts']` list with the type 'file'.\r\n\r\nError handling has been added to catch `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions during file reading, ensuring that the CLI skips invalid paths and continues processing other files.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement improves the usability of the CLI for tasks that require multiple file inputs.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

While using `metadata` is technically possible, it lacks consistency, standardization, and discoverability.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic when:\r\n\r\n- Multiple parts of the same type are included.\r\n- Agents are designed to consume named parameters of the same type (e.g., `query: str` and `context: str`)\r\n- Parts are dynamically generated by the request sender or appear in variable order.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution:\r\n\r\nIntroducing a dedicated `name` field provides a standardized, first-class way to label parts. This is more explicit, easier to validate, and more consistent across implementations than using `metadata`. It also helps avoid mismatches between clients and agents, and makes it simpler for task managers to map parts to agent invocation inputs.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details:\r\n\r\n- Updated JSON schema definitions to include an optional name field in each Part type.\r\n- Ensured backward compatibility by making the field optional.\r\n- Updated the protocol documentation to reflect the new `name` field and its usage.\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Improved clarity in `Part`s structures\r\n- Enables request parts validation\r\n\r\nFixes #461 ",

    "body": "feat: adds a resilient reimbursement agent using Restate\r\nThis pull request introduces a new sample agent, which demonstrates how to build a resilient A2A agents using [Restate](https://restate.dev/).\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nRestate is a framework that simplifies building resilient applications. In this example, Restate acts as a scalable, resilient task orchestrator that speaks the A2A protocol and gives you a lot of resiliency features: retries, recovery, task control, idempotency, etc. \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nBelow are the most important changes:\r\n\r\n* Created a `README.md` for the Restate reimbursement agent, explaining its features, prerequisites, setup instructions, and usage.\r\n* Added `__main__.py` to serve the Restate reimbursement agent as an A2A server.\r\n* Implemented the Restate equivalent of the A2A server and task manager in `middleware.py`\r\n* Implemented the core logic of the Restate agent in `agent.py`. This agent is identical to the Google ADK example. But now fully resilient.\r\n\r\n## How to run?\r\n\r\nSee example readme.\r\n\r\n**Note**: I ran the nox formatter which caused some tool parameters (`create_request_form`) to change from `Optional[str]` to `str | None` causing issues with the LLM calls. This also persists with the pure Google ADK example (https://github.com/google/A2A/issues/422) Therefore, I reverted those types to `Optional[str]`.",

    "body": "# Agent Fingerprinting System for A2A Protocol\r\n\r\n## Security Enhancement Overview\r\nThe fingerprinting system enhances A2A's security and trust framework by adding cryptographic verification of agent identities. This system addresses key security challenges in agent-to-agent communication through several critical mechanisms.\r\n\r\n## Key Security Features\r\n1. **Identity Verification**: Agents can cryptographically prove their identity using blockchain-based fingerprints, preventing impersonation attacks.\r\n\r\n2. **Message Integrity**: The system signs messages to ensure they haven't been tampered with during transmission, adding a layer of verification beyond basic transport security.\r\n\r\n3. **Decentralized Trust**: By using blockchain for verification, the system leverages decentralized trust rather than relying solely on centralized certificate authorities.\r\n\r\n4. **Enhanced Authentication**: The fingerprinting system extends A2A's authentication schemes with cryptographic proof, complementing existing methods like bearer tokens.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with A2A Goals\r\n- Supports the protocol's mission of secure cross-framework agent communication\r\n- Adds a verification layer for agent identity in line with enterprise security needs\r\n- Provides a flexible implementation that works with multiple blockchain networks\r\n- Extends A2A's agent card specification with fingerprint metadata\r\n\r\n## Implementation Approach\r\nThe implementation integrates seamlessly by extending existing client classes and following A2A's modular architecture, making it an opt-in feature that preserves backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nAdd a secure fingerprinting system to enhance A2A protocol authentication with:\r\n- Blockchain-based identity verification for agents\r\n- Cryptographic message integrity checks\r\n- Multi-chain verification support\r\n- Flexible validation mechanisms\r\n\r\nImplementation includes:\r\n- Fingerprint types and models\r\n- Generation and validation modules\r\n- A2A client integration\r\n- Unit tests\r\n\r\nBased on the dfdumaresq/Fingerprint project.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [x] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [x] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)",

An Agentic Profile lists AI agents that represent the entity, along with information about the agent such as service endpoints and authentication schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Decentralized Authentication\r\n\r\nBy default, the Agentic Profile supports decentralized authentication using JWT and public key cryptography.  Each agent listed in the DID document under the **service** property can provide **capabilityInvocation** information.  This information can include a named public key, or a reference to a named public key.\r\n\r\nWhen an agent is challenged, the agent uses its private key to create a JWT which includes both the challenge, and the agent's DID+agent id.  For example the DID did:web:example.com:iam:mike#coder would represent the DID document at https://example.com/iam/mike/did.json and the agent with the id \"#coder\" in the documents \"service\" list.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does the Agentic Profile integrate with A2A?\r\n\r\nEach A2A agent is listed in the **service** array property of the Agentic Profile/DID document using the following conventions:\r\n\r\n- The **serviceEndpoint** property is a URL to the A2A agent (when not ending in / or agent.json), or the agent card (when ending in / or agent.json)\r\n- The service **type** is A2A",

    "body": "# Protocol updates\r\n\r\nThis PR makes some clarifications around several concepts and intends to make simple 'chit-chat' like scenarios, or stateless interactions, easier. In particular:\r\n\r\n- Introduces a messageId that is created by the message creator (both client and server)\r\n- Clarifies the ownership of a taskId. This is always determined by the server (if/when a task is needed). Client should send follow up messages with the relevant taskId to continue interactions around an existing task\r\n- Changes the name 'sessionId' to 'contextId' and allows it to be attached to messages and tasks. The server is responsible for creating the contextId and the client is responsible for using it to continue interactions with shared context.\r\n- Introduces a new message/send endpoint. This is parallel to the task/send endpoint (which is deprecated as of this PR and will be removed in a future PR). This endpoint returns either a Message object (if there is not state/task to track) or a task object. If the request is blocking, it will only return when the task is in a suspended state. If the request is non-blocking, it will return the status of the initial task creation. The client can then poll for task updates.\r\n- Introduces a new message/stream endpoint. This is parallel to the task/sendSubscribe endpoint (which is deprecated as of this PR and will be removed in a future PR). The endpoint has the following expectations:\r\n   - If the response is a simple Message with no statefulness, returns a Message and the channel should be closed.\r\n   - Otherwise, the first thing returned is an initial task object with the 'submitted' state. Each subsequent event is a TaskStatusUpdateEvent or TaskArtifactUpdateEvent until the final TaskStatusUpdateEvent is received.\r\n\r\nThe demo UI app and the cli app have been updated to use the new endpoints, and no longer use the old ones. The biggest delta is that the new endpoints create the task and context identifiers when the remote agent deems it necessary, and the client is not responsible (nor should) generate these itself. Also, all messages are required to have a messageId with a value created by the sender. To continue a multi-turn interaction the same contextId must be used in subsequent messages send from the client to the server. To continue an interaction within the scope of a task, the contextId and taskId must be included in the message sent from the client.",

    "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nIn client-server messaging, the A2A protocol uses the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) format, and the protocol specification is written using the [JSON-Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/). Fully complying with the standards can help validate the payloads more accurately and help better test different client and server implementations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the A2A spec more compliant with the mentioned standards, changes in this PR are meant to fix a few minor bugs in the A2A protocol spec (mismatches from what was implemented in the sample A2A server and clients.\r\n\r\nAddresses issue #353.\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n* Makes field \"id\" required on requests and responses. This field is important because, according to the JSON RPC 2.0 spec, a message that does not have an \"id\" is considered a notification, and the callee does not have to send a response to such requests. Similarly, without the \"id\" on the responses, the caller cannot correlate the responses to the pending requests, meaning that fully JSON-RPC-compliant clients would not be able to resolve such RPC calls.\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Edit: clearer wording + add issue references*\r\n\r\n*Edit2: the scope of this PR has been reduced due to other updates fixing parts of the spec, summary items were edited to reflect what has already been addressed in other PRs.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## (OLD) Summary of changes\r\n\r\n* Add a missing definition for \"TaskSendParams.acceptedOutputModes\" (described in #354). Fixed in #599.\r\n\r\n* Remove \"default\" values for \"const\" fields. Compliance with JSON schema, version `>=draft-6` and reduce ambiguity. https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/const\r\nFixed in #599\r\n\r\n* Make fields \"jsonrpc\" and \"id\" required on requests and responses. Compliance with JSON-RPC 2.0.\r\n\r\n* Make fields \"error.code\" and \"error.message\" required on errors. Fixed in #599.\r\n\r\n* In a few places, sort non-top-level dict keys to make them more aligned with the pydantic JSON schema outputs. Since now, we are discouraged from editing the spec manually, this item also drops out of the scope of our concerns.\r\n\r\n* The initial commit in this PR also included cleaning up several unnecessary \"null\" types, which were addressed more thoroughly in #352.\r\n\r\n## (OLD) Additional notes\r\n\r\nWhile I sorted dictionaries within each model so that the keys of each model would be in the same order as the pydantic-based scripts' exports, at the same time, **I decided not to sort the top-level keys** (`$defs/ModelKey`). Because doing so would make the diff ugly and harder to read the applied changes. The top-level key sorting can be done afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE\r\nfix!: Resolve spec inconsistencies with JSON-RPC 2.0\r\nEND_COMMIT_OVERRIDE\r\n",

    "body": "# Add First-Class Scheduled Tasks to A2A Protocol\r\n\r\nClose: https://github.com/google/A2A/issues/210\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the A2A JSON-RPC API to support recurring, cron-style **scheduled tasks**. It enables clients to register, list, update, and delete schedules **without** relying on external cron infrastructure.\r\n\r\nEach schedule automatically triggers the existing `tasks/send` engine at configured times, with support for optional timezone settings and start/end bounds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, the A2A protocol only supports one-off task submissions (`tasks/send`) and real-time updates. Many integrations, however, require **built-in scheduling** — e.g., “run this job every night at 2 AM UTC” — without having to manage separate cron systems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What’s Changed\r\n\r\n### 1. New RPC Namespace\r\n\r\nNew methods have been added under `tasks/schedule/`:\r\n\r\n- `tasks/schedule/create`\r\n- `tasks/schedule/list`\r\n- `tasks/schedule/update`\r\n- `tasks/schedule/delete`\r\n\r\n### 2. Cron-Style Scheduling Parameters\r\n\r\nEach scheduled task supports:\r\n\r\n- A cron expression (standard 5- or 6-field format)\r\n- Optional [IANA timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (default: UTC)\r\n- Optional `startTime` and `endTime` bounds\r\n\r\n### 3. Payload Reuse\r\n\r\n- The task payload for a schedule is the same as the existing `TaskSendParams`:\r\n  - `id`, `sessionId`, `message` parts, `pushNotification`, etc.\r\n- When a schedule fires, the server generates a standard A2A `tasks/send` request using the provided payload.\r\n\r\n### 4. JSON Schema Additions\r\n\r\nNew types added under `\"$defs\"` in `specification/json/a2a.json`:\r\n\r\n- `ScheduledTask` (includes `id`, `cron`, and `TaskSendParams`)\r\n- `ScheduledTaskCreateParams`\r\n- `ScheduledTaskUpdateParams`\r\n- `ScheduledTaskListParams`\r\n- `ScheduledTaskIdParams`\r\n- Plus corresponding request/response objects for each new RPC method\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nCreate a nightly “heartbeat” job at 02:00 UTC:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": \"1\",\r\n  \"method\": \"tasks/schedule/create\",\r\n  \"params\": {\r\n    \"schedule\": \"0 2 * * *\",\r\n    \"task\": {\r\n      \"sessionId\": \"sys-health\",\r\n      \"message\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"ping\" }],\r\n      \"pushNotification\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"https://hooks.slack.com/...\",\r\n        \"token\": \"secret\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n",

So, I cloned the `main` branch into a new location (with no preexisting `.venv`'s) and after running `uv sync` noticed that `uv.lock` was out of sync and the \"a2a-samples\" dependency was missing in `hosts/cli` and `hosts/multiagent`. While the `multiagent` still worked from `demo/ui` because `demo/ui` directly requires \"a2a-samples,\" the CLI client did not.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the CLI client works as expected.\r\n\r\n### uv version:\r\n\r\n* uv 0.6.14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRefs: basically, this is a follow-up to PR #182",

Advanced agentic collaboration requires sharing and accessing dynamic operational knowledge in a safe and verifiable way. This extension defines standardized methods for KG query, update, and subscription, providing enhanced protocol-level reasoning, alignment, and multi-agent understanding functionality. It prominently features support for GraphQL as the primary query language.\r\n\r\nA secondary objective of the extension is enabling **A2A** protocol compliance with major security and AI frameworks such as the **EU AI Act**, **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** (**RMF**), **ISO/IEC** standards (including **42001** for **AI Management Systems** and **23894** for **AI Risk Management**), and ethical guidelines like the **Australian AI Ethics Framework**, by providing standardized mechanisms for auditability, provenance tracking, capability declaration, and verifiable knowledge updates.\r\n\r\nA complete analysis of the system's compliance parameters can be found in the guide here:\r\n- [A2A COMPLIANCE GUIDE (WIP)](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/A2A/blob/main/A2A_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Client-Server Conceptual Flow\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    participant ClientAgent as Agent A (Client)\r\n    participant ServerAgent as Agent B (Server w/ KG)\r\n\r\n    ClientAgent->>+ServerAgent: knowledge/query (GraphQL Query)\r\n    ServerAgent->>-ClientAgent: knowledge/query Response (GraphQL Result)\r\n\r\n    ClientAgent->>+ServerAgent: knowledge/update (KG Patches, Justification)\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ServerAgent: Verify Patches (Alignment Check)\r\n    ServerAgent->>-ClientAgent: knowledge/update Response (Success/Fail, Verification Status)\r\n\r\n    ClientAgent->>+ServerAgent: knowledge/subscribe (GraphQL Subscription)\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ServerAgent: Establish Subscription\r\n    Note over ServerAgent: KG Change Occurs\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ClientAgent: SSE Stream: KnowledgeSubscriptionEvent (Change Data)\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ClientAgent: SSE Stream: ...

`InMemoryTaskManager`):**\r\n    *   Added abstract method signatures for `on_knowledge_query`, `on_knowledge_update`, `on_knowledge_subscribe` to the `TaskManager` ABC.\r\n    *   Provided placeholder implementations in `InMemoryTaskManager` that return `UnsupportedOperationError`. *(Note: Real implementation requires KG/GraphQL backend)*.\r\n    *   Added placeholder for `knowledge_sse_subscribers` dictionary.\r\n\r\n**Key Features Implemented:**\r\n\r\n*   Protocol definition for KG Query, Update, and Subscription methods.\r\n*   Explicit support for GraphQL (`queryLanguage`, `variables`).\r\n*   Standardized data models for KG statements and patches.\r\n*   Incorporation of specialized safety and compliance concepts: `certainty`, `provenance`, `justification`, `verificationStatus`, `metadata` fields.\r\n*   Capability flags (`knowledgeGraph`, `knowledgeGraphQueryLanguages`) in `AgentCard`.\r\n*   Client methods for utilizing the new features.\r\n*   Server routing and basic capability checks for new methods.\r\n*   Updated JSON Schema specification.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Notes:**\r\n\r\n*   The server-side logic in `InMemoryTaskManager` for handling the actual KG operations and GraphQL execution is **not implemented** in this PR (placeholders returning `UnsupportedOperationError`). A concrete agent implementation will need to provide this using appropriate backend libraries (e.g., RDFLib + Ariadne).\r\n*   Subscription management (tracking subscribers, matching changes to queries) is also part of the backend implementation left for concrete agents.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*   Added/updated unit tests for new types in `common/types.py`.\r\n*   Added basic unit tests for new `A2AClient` methods (checking request formation).\r\n*   Added basic tests for `A2AServer` routing of new methods (checking capability errors and routing to manager stubs).\r\n*   *TODO:* Integration tests require a mock or real agent implementation with KG/GraphQL capabilities.\r\n\r\n**Reviewer Guidance:**\r\n\r\n*   Please review the API design of the new methods (`knowledge/*`).\r\n*   Check the correctness and completeness of the new Pydantic types and the JSON schema (`a2a.json`).\r\n*   Verify the client method implementations and server routing logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Enhancing A2A: Knowledge Graph Collaboration\r\n\r\n## The Need for Structured Knowledge\r\n\r\nWhile the base A2A protocol excels at task-based communication, complex AI collaboration requires a deeper, shared understanding of the world – entities, concepts, relationships, and processes. Knowledge Graphs offer a flexible and powerful way to represent this structured information. This extension provides the standard mechanisms for agents to leverage KGs within the A2A framework.\r\n\r\n## Core Features\r\n\r\nThis extension introduces a new `knowledge/` namespace with methods that allow agents to:\r\n\r\n1.  ❓ **Query Knowledge (`knowledge/query`)**\r\n    *   Ask questions of another agent's KG using standardized query languages.\r\n    *   **GraphQL First:** Explicit support for **GraphQL** queries and variables.\r\n    *   *Example:* \"Find all tasks assigned to 'agent-x' that are currently 'working'.\"\r\n\r\n2.  ✍️ **Update Knowledge (`knowledge/update`)**\r\n    *   Propose additions or removals of specific facts (statements/triples) to another agent's KG.\r\n    *   Includes fields for `justification` and `sourceAgentId` for provenance and auditability.\r\n    *   Receiving agent verifies updates against its internal rules and alignment constraints.\r\n    *   *Example:* \"Add the fact that 'task-123' has produced 'artifact-abc'.\"\r\n\r\n3.  🔔 **Subscribe to Knowledge Changes (`knowledge/subscribe`)**\r\n    *   Receive real-time notifications (via Server-Sent Events) when specific parts of an agent's KG change.\r\n    *   Uses **GraphQL Subscriptions** to define the data of interest.\r\n    *   *Example:* \"Notify me whenever the status of any task associated with 'project-alpha' changes.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Reasoning, Safety & Compliance\r\n\r\n*   **Cognitive Mapping & Symbolic Reasoning:** Can directly represent the symbolic relationships modeled in knowledge bases, cognitive maps, and structured / discrete spaces.\r\n*   **Multi-Agent Reasoning:** Provides the foundation for shared understanding needed for complex collaborative reasoning.  \r\n*   **Secure Collaboration:** `metadata` fields allow secure context passing; update verification enforces rules.\r\n*   **Alignment & Auditability:** `provenance`, `certainty`, `justification`, and `verificationStatus` fields support verifiable and aligned AI behavior.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n*   **Richer Agent Interaction:** Moves beyond simple tasking to deep knowledge sharing.\r\n*   **Improved Contextual Awareness:** Agents can query for relevant background information.\r\n*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Enables joint knowledge base construction and maintenance.\r\n*   **Standardization:** Provides a common protocol layer for diverse KG backends and GraphQL engines.\r\n*   **Foundation for Advanced Machine Intelligence:** Supports capabilities like shared understanding, complex reasoning, and verifiable alignment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n- [x] Updating the TS/JS (web) sample server and client.\r\n- [ ] Creating a sample Python agent (TBD).\r\n- [ ] Creating a sample web agent (TBD).\r\n- [ ] Updating the demo UI with a knowledge-sharing workflow (TBD).\r\n- Implementing agents will require integrating KG storage (e.g., RDFLib, GraphDB, Neo4j) and a GraphQL engine (e.g., Ariadne, Graphene) into the A2A server implementation.\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n- [KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EXTENSION README](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/A2A/blob/main/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_EXTENSION.md)\r\n- [COMPLIANCE GUIDE (WIP)](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/A2A/blob/main/A2A_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md)\r\n\r\n---\r\n",

    "body": "feat: Add Pydantic AI Summarizer Agent with A2A Integration\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces the `SummarizerAgent`, a new agent built using Pydantic AI, showcasing how to integrate this library with the A2A framework. The `SummarizerAgent` is designed to take a text string as input and return a concise summary of that text.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nThis example provides a clear illustration of how Pydantic AI can be leveraged to create agents and how such agents can be easily integrated into the A2A ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/agent.py`:**\r\n    -   Defines the `SummarizerAgent` class, inheriting from Pydantic's `BaseModel`.\r\n    -   Utilizes Pydantic AI's `@AICallable` decorator to define the `summarize` method, which handles the summarization logic.\r\n    -   Configures the agent to use the OpenAI API key fetched from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.\r\n    -   The summarize function has a string as input, and a string as output.\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/__main__.py`:**\r\n    -   Creates an instance of the `SummarizerAgent`.\r\n    -   Wraps the agent instance in an `A2AAgent` to make it compatible with the A2A protocol.\r\n    -   Starts an `A2AServer` to host the agent and handle incoming A2A requests.\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/README.md`:**\r\n    -   Provides instructions on how to run the agent locally.\r\n    -   Explains how to connect to the agent.\r\n    -   Describes the input and output of the agent.\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/__init__.py`**:\r\n    - Empty file, to make the module a python module.\r\n\r\n**How to Run and Test:**\r\n\r\n1.  Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.\r\n2.  Navigate to the `samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/` directory.\r\n3.  Execute `python __main__.py`.\r\n4.  Find the agent card url printed on the console.\r\n5. Add the agent to the demo UI or any other A2A client.\r\n6. You will be able to interact with the agent, sending texts and getting summaries.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n-   Provides a practical example of using Pydantic AI for agent development.\r\n-   Demonstrates the integration of a Pydantic AI agent with the A2A framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

First with `bind_tools` to get a response that knows about the tools (stored in message history)\r\n2. Then with `with_structured_output` to get a structured response (stored in structured_response)\r\n\r\nThese two responses can be inconsistent, as mentioned in issue google-a2a/a2a-samples#117. The first response (with tools) appears in the message history, while the second response (structured) appears in the `structured_response` field.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThe fix modifies the `get_agent_response` method to prioritize the message from the message history over the structured output when they conflict:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Get the last message from the message history\r\n# This is the response from the first LLM call with bind_tools\r\nmessages = current_state.values.get('messages', [])\r\nlast_message_content = None\r\nif messages and len(messages) > 0:\r\n    last_message = messages[-1]\r\n    if isinstance(last_message, AIMessage) and last_message.content:\r\n        last_message_content = last_message.content\r\n\r\n# Use the message from the message history if available, otherwise use the structured response\r\nmessage_content = last_message_content or structured_response.message\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nI created a simple test script to verify that the fix works as expected. The test confirms that:\r\n\r\n1. The original implementation uses only the structured content, which can be inconsistent with the message history\r\n2. The fixed implementation prioritizes the message content from the message history, which is more likely to be correct\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that the response shown to the user is consistent with the tool usage and reasoning shown in the message history, which is important for a good user experience.",
