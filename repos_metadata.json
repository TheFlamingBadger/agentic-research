Extension profiles are\ndocuments that describe modifications or additions to the core A2A\nprofile. AgentCards can declare supported extensions via\n`capabilities.extensions`. This declaration can include additional\ninformation via `capabilities.extensions.params`. Clients can use this\nas a basis for extension negotiation: if a client supports an extension\nthat the server supports, the client can then follow the protocol\ndefined by the extension. This can include, but is not specifically\nlimited to:\n\n1. Requiring specific structure of messages, such as following a\nspecific schema for a DataPart.\n2. Providing additional information in request/response Message and\nArtifact objects via their `metadata` field.\n3. Exposing additional methods beyond the core A2A protocol methods.\n\nMessages and Artifacts can now include an indication of which extensions\nare present in their content. I do not yet know if extension indications\nare necessary on other data structures (such as `MessageSendParams` or\n`TaskStatus`). I'd say extension indications are not strictly necessary\nat all: it's possible to infer that an extension was followed by\ninspecting the message content itself (are the metadata fields you\nexpect present, does the DataPart follow the schema you expect, etc).\nHowever, they are useful for validation and simplifying extension\nimplementation logic: \"you said you followed this extension, so I'll\nvalidate fields are present and then perform my processing\".\n\nFixes #585\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Holt Skinner <13262395+holtskinner@users.noreply.github.com>",

        "message": "fix(spec): Spec inconsistencies and a minor bug (#322)\n\n## Problem\n\nIn client-server messaging, the A2A protocol uses the [JSON-RPC\n2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) format, and the protocol\nspecification is written using the [JSON-Schema\nspecification](https://json-schema.org/). Fully complying with the\nstandards can help validate the payloads more accurately and help better\ntest different client and server implementations.\n\nIn addition to making the A2A spec more compliant with the mentioned\nstandards, changes in this PR are meant to fix a few minor bugs in the\nA2A protocol spec (mismatches from what was implemented in the sample\nA2A server and clients.\n\nAddresses issue #353.\n\n## Summary of changes\n* Makes field \"id\" required on requests and responses. This field is\nimportant because, according to the JSON RPC 2.0 spec, a message that\ndoes not have an \"id\" is considered a notification, and the callee does\nnot have to send a response to such requests. Similarly, without the\n\"id\" on the responses, the caller cannot correlate the responses to the\npending requests, meaning that fully JSON-RPC-compliant clients would\nnot be able to resolve such RPC calls.\n\n---\n*Edit: clearer wording + add issue references*\n\n*Edit2: the scope of this PR has been reduced due to other updates\nfixing parts of the spec, summary items were edited to reflect what has\nalready been addressed in other PRs.*\n\n---\n\n## (OLD) Summary of changes\n\n* Add a missing definition for \"TaskSendParams.acceptedOutputModes\"\n(described in #354). Fixed in #599.\n\n* Remove \"default\" values for \"const\" fields. Compliance with JSON\nschema, version `>=draft-6` and reduce ambiguity.\nhttps://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/const\nFixed in #599\n\n* Make fields \"jsonrpc\" and \"id\" required on requests and responses.\nCompliance with JSON-RPC 2.0.\n\n* Make fields \"error.code\" and \"error.message\" required on errors. Fixed\nin #599.\n\n* In a few places, sort non-top-level dict keys to make them more\naligned with the pydantic JSON schema outputs. Since now, we are\ndiscouraged from editing the spec manually, this item also drops out of\nthe scope of our concerns.\n\n* The initial commit in this PR also included cleaning up several\nunnecessary \"null\" types, which were addressed more thoroughly in #352.\n\n## (OLD) Additional notes\n\nWhile I sorted dictionaries within each model so that the keys of each\nmodel would be in the same order as the pydantic-based scripts' exports,\nat the same time, **I decided not to sort the top-level keys**\n(`$defs/ModelKey`). Because doing so would make the diff ugly and harder\nto read the applied changes. The top-level key sorting can be done\nafterward.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Holt Skinner <13262395+holtskinner@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: kthota-g <kcthota@google.com>",

It's also difficult to understand, what is \"Agent implementor\", the person implementing the agent? \"llm\" should be uppercase \"LLM\".\n\nThroughout the page there are more grammatical errors and inconsistent usage of backticks and capitalisation."

These gaps could become attack vectors in integrated deployments.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI propose that A2A adopt OAuth 2.1-compliant authorization mechanisms, similar to MCP. This would include defining how agents obtain, present, and validate access tokens, and how authorization servers integrate with agent discovery and agent identity information (e.g., Agent Cards).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nOAuth 2.1 is the latest evolution of the OAuth standard, consolidating best practices and removing deprecated flows. Aligning A2A with this standard would enhance trust, interoperability, and security across agent ecosystems.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

These fields complement the existing `inputModes` and `outputModes`, which specify supported mime types.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, agent skills declare only `inputModes` and `outputModes` as lists of mime types. While this indicates supported data formats (e.g., `\"text/plain\"`, `\"image/png\"`), it does **not** convey the **structure or semantics** of the input/output data, such as named fields or their types. In some use cases, this makes it difficult for clients to:\r\n\r\n- Understand what specific inputs an agent expects or outputs it produces  \r\n- Properly validate, log, or debug message contents  \r\n- Create user interfaces with meaningful form fields to invoke an agent\r\n- Handle multiple fields of the same type in a structured way\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new optional layer by defining a `FieldDefinition` model, which lets agents declare:\r\n\r\n- Named input and output fields that are expected to be received and returned by a skill\r\n- Field kinds (`text`, `file`, `data`)  \r\n- Supported mime types for each field  \r\n- Optional JSON schemas for structured data fields  \r\n- Field descriptions and optionality flags  \r\n\r\nThe `AgentSkill` model is extended with two new optional lists: `inputFields` and `outputFields`. These provide a semantic, machine-readable description of the skill interface, while retaining backward compatibility by keeping `inputModes` and `outputModes`.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n- Enables clients to build more precise and user-friendly input forms  \r\n- Improves clarity and reduces ambiguity in message composition  \r\n- Facilitates validation, logging, and debugging with schema support  \r\n- Supports complex skills with multiple inputs/outputs of the same type  \r\n- Provides a semantic layer that builds upon existing mime type declarations\r\n\r\nCloses #813 \r\n\r\nIdea emerged from discussion in: #462 \r\n"

        "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nYes. The protocol currently supports `inputModes` and `outputModes` (e.g., supported mime types) for agent skills, but lacks a structured way for agents to optionally declare named input and output fields they expect or produce, along with their types or schemas.\n\nThis makes it harder for clients to know the exact structure and meaning of inputs an agent expects or outputs it produces, especially when multiple fields of the same type are involved.\n\n### Motivation\n\n- Enable agents to declare **named input/output fields** with type information.\n- Support **schemas** for better validation, logging, debugging, etc\n- Let clients render structured forms to collect user input appropriately.\n- Reduce ambiguity in how message/artifact parts are composed and interpreted.\n- Provide a more **semantic layer** on top of the existing input/output modes.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIntroduce optional structured field definitions for agent input and output, using a new `FieldDefinition` model. Agents can declare named fields, their content kind (text, file, data), optional mime types or schemas, and a description. These would complement the `inputModes`/`outputModes` on the `AgentSkill`\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import Literal, Any, List, Optional\n\nclass FieldDefinition(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Describes an expected input or output field.\n    \"\"\"\n    name: str | None = None\n    kind: Literal['text', 'file', 'data'] | None = None\n    mimeTypes: list[str] | None= None\n    schema: dict[str, Any] | None = None  # For data parts\n    description: str | None = None\n    optional: bool | None = False\n\nclass AgentSkill(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a unit of capability that an agent can perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    description: str\n    examples: list[str] | None = None\n    id: str\n    name: str\n    tags: list[str]\n\n    # Existing simple mime-type lists remain supported:\n    inputModes: list[str] | None = None\n    outputModes: list[str] | None = None\n\n    # New optional structured fields for richer metadata:\n    inputFields: list[FieldDefinition] | None = None\n    outputFields: list[FieldDefinition] | None = None\n```\n\nMessage senders can then match named parts accordingly. The protocol may also define conventions for how these fields map to a `Part.name` or `DataPart.data.keys`.\n\n#### Example: Book Review Agent\n\nAn agent expects two text inputs:\n\n- bookTitle: The book’s title\n- authorName: The author’s name\n\nAnd returns two text outputs:\n\n- review-chunk: A chunk of the book's review\n- publicationDate: When the book was published\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputModes\": [\"text/plain\"],\n  \"outputModes\": [\"text/plain\", \"text/html\"],\n  \"inputFields\": [\n    { \"name\": \"bookTitle\", \"kind\": \"text\", \"description\": \"The title of the book\" },\n    { \"name\": \"authorName\", \"kind\": \"text\", \"description\": \"The author's full name\" }\n  ],\n  \"outputFields\": [\n    { \"name\": \"review-chunk\",\n      \"kind\": \"text\",\n      \"mimeTypes\": [\"text/plain\"],\n      \"description\": \"A chunk of the book's review.

Sent when not streaming.\",\n      \"optional\": true,\n    },\n    { \"name\": \"publicationDate\", \"kind\": \"text\", \"description\": \"Publication date\"}\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nClient sending a message to the agent:\n\n```py\nmessage = Message(\n    parts=[\n        Part(\n           root=DataPart(\n              data={\n                   \"bookTitle\": TextPart(text=\"Charlotte's Web\"),\n                   \"authorName\": TextPart(text=\"E. B. White\")\n              }\n        )\n    ],\n    # other Message fields as needed\n)\n```\n\nAgent response with Task and Artifacts:\n\n```py\nresult = Task(\n    taskId: \"task1\",\n    contextId=\"context1\",\n    final=True,\n    status=TaskStatus(state=\"completed\"),\n    artifacts=[\n        Artifact(\n           artifactId=\"artifact1\",\n               name=\"review-html\",\n               parts=[Part(root=TextPart(text=\"<div><h3>Review</h3><p>E.B.

I would recommend a central repo to host all .proto files and have the generated stubs in a central repo and use CI to  publish them as artifacts, which each client can consume as a dependency. \n\nWe should also seek to have the specification act as the main source of truth for the proto specs. An option here would be to use something like IDL (Interface Definition Language) to parse out the specificiation to proto files.\n\nWe could then have the following:\n\nProtobuf / gRPC .proto files: already defines messages (types) and services (methods) and can be used to generate both stubs and documentation - useful for go and python\n\nI expect we would also use grpc-gateway to expose a rest interface for a2a typescipt , which in turn could render OpenAPI (Swagger).\n\nI think the first action would be to centralise proto files, so we could do with a repo as follows: /a2aproject/protobuf-specs\n"

In my organization, we are working on a serverless architecture with the host agent being hosted as a Lambda function. We were facing a few issues with the Host agent, where it takes a few seconds before initialization(cold start), and the lambda returns a 501 error as it times out within a previously set limit(60 seconds). The original request that was queried takes more than 60 seconds due to the initialization.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we could provision an EC2 Instance, but am I missing something here? Could this be fixed with a serverless architecture? \n\nPlease feel free to provide your inputs and thoughts. \n\nThanks. "

In this case, virtually no changes.\r\n- Adds lint exceptions for those lint rules that do not pass `buf lint`. This now ensures that `buf lint` passes.\r\n- Updates a few comments in `buf.yaml` for clarification.\r\n- Updates the `README.md` to use `buf lint` instead of `buf build`.

The orchestration logic (e.g., deciding whether to trigger \"Tool A\" vs \"Tool B\") is quite simple and deterministic.\n\nI would like to avoid using an LLM (_as shown in the [a2a_mcp](https://github.com/google-a2a/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents/a2a_mcp) sample_) to make this decision for every query, as that introduces latency and unnecessary cost for a fixed logic path.\n\nInstead, I'm exploring the option of having the user message include a `\"kind\": \"data\"` payload with a `task_type` field (e.g., `\"task_type\": \"tool_a\"`), which can map directly to a known AgentSkill in the `AgentCard`.\n\nTo wrap up, my question is:\n\n> **Is this an idiomatic or recommended A2A-compliant way to structure task routing logic without requiring a dedicated orchestrator agent or LLMAgent?**\n\nAny thoughts or design recommendations would be appreciated."

Please describe.\n\nThe current Agent-to-Agent (A2A) authorization guidelines are too high-level, failing to adequately address the complex authorization needs of modern enterprise environments. As more organizations migrate to agent registry models for A2A discovery, they face challenges in implementing granular control over agent interactions. Existing authorization mechanisms, limited to skills, actions, and OAuth scopes, are insufficient for scenarios requiring more precise policy configurations.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe are requesting an expansion of the A2A authorization implementation guidelines to include a **fine-grained authorization framework**. This framework should provide concrete scenarios and guidance for configuring policies based on **agent containers**. By enabling the logical grouping of agents using attributes within these containers, and then defining policies beyond the current scope limitations, enterprises can achieve a higher level of control and security. This would allow agents to operate within clearly defined boundaries, even as authorization implementations vary based on specific business requirements.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

private contextGraph: Map<string, ContextNode> = new Map();\n  private temporalValidator: TemporalConsistencyValidator;\n  private causalInferencer: CausalInferenceEngine;\n\n  maintainContextGraph(conversation: Conversation): ContextGraph {\n    // Build directed graph of conversation context\n    const nodes = this.extractContextNodes(conversation);\n    const edges =

this.predictEffects(msg)\n    }));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Semantic Similarity & Compatibility Scoring\n```typescript\nclass VectorSemanticMatcher implements SemanticCompatibilityMatcher {\n  private

(magnitudeA * magnitudeB);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 🔧 SPECIFIC CODING GUIDELINES\n\n### A2A Protocol Compliance\n- ✅ **Maintain JSON-RPC 2.0 Structure**: All enhancements must preserve existing protocol communication patterns\n- ✅ **Async-First Design**: Use generators for streaming, event-driven patterns for long-running tasks\n- ✅ **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript interfaces extensively, Python dataclasses for structured data\n- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure agents without semantic capabilities can still communicate\n\n### Performance Optimization\n- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis-based caching for semantic embeddings and intent classifications\n- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Group similar intent analysis requests for efficiency\n- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Load NLP models only when semantic features are requested\n- ✅ **Memory Management**: Implement context graph pruning for long conversations\n\n### Error Handling & Fallbacks\n```typescript\nclass SemanticErrorHandler {\n  static async handleIntentAnalysisFailure(\n    originalMessage: Message, \n    error: Error\n  ): Promise<Message> {\n    console.warn(`Semantic analysis failed: ${error.message}. Falling back to syntactic processing.`);\n    \n    // Graceful degradation to standard A2A processing\n    return {\n      ...originalMessage,\n      semanticMetadata: {\n        analysisStatus: 'failed',\n        fallbackMode: true,\n        errorReason: error.message\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── semantic/\n│   ├── intent/\n│   │   ├──

communication patterns\n- ✅ **Async-First Design**: Use generators for streaming, event-driven patterns for long-running tasks\n- ✅ **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript interfaces extensively, Python dataclasses for structured data\n- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure agents without semantic capabilities can still communicate\n\n### Performance Optimization\n- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis-based caching for semantic embeddings and intent classifications\n- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Group similar intent analysis requests for efficiency\n- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Load NLP models only when semantic features are requested\n- ✅ **Memory Management**: Implement context graph pruning for long conversations\n\n### Error Handling & Fallbacks\n```typescript\nclass SemanticErrorHandler {\n  static async handleIntentAnalysisFailure(\n    originalMessage: Message, \n    error: Error\n  ): Promise<Message> {\n    console.warn(`Semantic analysis failed: ${error.message}. Falling back to syntactic processing.`);\n    \n    // Graceful degradation to standard A2A processing\n    return {\n      ...originalMessage,\n      semanticMetadata: {\n        analysisStatus: 'failed',\n        fallbackMode: true,\n        errorReason: error.message\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── semantic/\n│   ├── intent/\n│   │   ├──

similarity calculations\n- ✅ Temporal consistency validation\n\n### Integration Tests\n- ✅ End-to-end semantic intent flow\n- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing A2A agents\n- ✅ Performance under load with concurrent semantic processing\n- ✅ Fallback behavior when semantic analysis fails\n\n### Example Test Cases\n```typescript\ndescribe('SemanticIntentEngine', () => {\n  test('should extract complex multi-goal intents', async () => {\n    const message = \"I need to book a hotel in Paris for next week and also arrange airport transfer that considers my flight delay risk\";\n    \n    const intent = await intentAnalyzer.analyzeIntent(message, context);\n    \n    expect(intent.primaryGoal.type).toBe('accommodation_booking');\n    expect(intent.secondaryGoals).toHaveLength(1);\n    expect(intent.constraints).toContain('temporal_dependency');\n    expect(intent.reasoningChain).toBeDefined();\n  });\n\n  test('should maintain context across conversation turns', async () => {\n    const conversation = createTestConversation();\n    const contextGraph = contextEngine.maintainContextGraph(conversation);\n    \n    expect(contextGraph.nodes).toHaveLength(conversation.messages.length);\n    expect(contextGraph.temporalOrder.isConsistent()).toBe(true);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES\n\n### Phase 1:

AgentCards can declare supported extensions via `capabilities.extensions`. This declaration can include additional information via `capabilities.extensions.params`. Clients can use this as a basis for extension negotiation: if a client supports an extension that the server supports, the client can then follow the protocol defined by the extension. This can include, but is not specifically limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Requiring specific structure of messages, such as following a specific schema for a DataPart.\r\n2. Providing additional information in request/response Message and Artifact objects via their `metadata` field.\r\n3. Exposing additional methods beyond the core A2A protocol methods.\r\n\r\nMessages and Artifacts can now include an indication of which extensions are present in their content. I do not yet know if extension indications are necessary on other data structures (such as `MessageSendParams` or `TaskStatus`). I'd say extension indications are not strictly necessary at all: it's possible to infer that an extension was followed by inspecting the message content itself (are the metadata fields you expect present, does the DataPart follow the schema you expect, etc). However, they are useful for validation and simplifying extension implementation logic: \"you said you followed this extension, so I'll validate fields are present and then perform my processing\".\r\n\r\nFixes #585 "

Schema Enhancement ([types.ts](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/))\r\nAdded [metadata](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) field to [TaskStatus](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) interface:\r\nNew optional property:\r\nThis enables agents and runtimes to attach arbitrary custom metadata to each task status update, supporting richer integrations and extensibility.\r\n2. Server Logic Alignment (a2aServer.ts)\r\nImplemented metadata merging for task status updates:\r\nWhen updating a task’s status, if metadata is present in the update, it is shallow-merged with any existing metadata on the task’s status.\r\n## Example logic:\r\nThis ensures that partial [metadata](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) updates do not overwrite existing keys unintentionally, and aligns runtime behavior with the new schema.\r\n## Motivation:\r\nThese changes bring TaskStatus in line with other extensible objects in the A2A schema, enabling agent runtimes to support custom, task-level [metadata](https://organic-space-computing-machine-97prppwvv64frjv.github.dev/) throughout the task lifecycle. The server logic ensures that metadata updates are handled in a non-destructive, composable way.\r\n\r\n## Impact:\r\n\r\nBackward compatible (the new field is optional).\r\nEnables richer agent-to-agent and client-to-agent integrations.\r\nNo breaking changes to existing consumers.\r\nLet me know if you need a sample PR description or further breakdown!\r\n- Extend TaskStatus interface to include an optional  field for custom task-level metadata.\r\n- Add/align server logic to merge TaskStatus.metadata on update, ensuring non-destructive extensibility.\r\n- Enables richer agent-to-agent and client-to-agent integrations and brings TaskStatus in line with other extensible objects in the A2A schema.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [ x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [ x] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [x ] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [x ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #275 🦕\r\n"

The output is provided below.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nSince we can install the official `a2a-sdk` package from PyPI, instead of using `samples/python/requirements.txt`, we can update the tutorial to install the `a2a-sdk` in accordance with the [README](https://github.com/google-a2a/a2a-python/blob/88d45ebd935724e6c3ad614bf503defae4de5d85/README.md) from the SDK repository.\n```shell\npip install a2a-sdk\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nERROR: Invalid requirement: 'a2a-sdk>=latest': Expected end or semicolon (after name and no valid version specifier)\n    a2a-sdk>=latest\n           ^ (from line 1 of samples/python/requirements.txt)\n```\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Please describe.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nCurrently, in the A2A Registry protocol, internal dependencies between Agents are not explicitly declared. For example, a Shopping Agent might depend on an Image Recognition Agent to analyze image content. This dependency relationship is important.\n\nWhile A2A might allow Agents to infer or suggest dependencies dynamically through conversation or LLM-based reasoning, explicitly declaring these dependencies within the Agent Card itself can greatly simplify unified management and visibility. Having dependency information upfront in the Agent Card helps operators and systems understand and visualize the dependency graph more clearly.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI would like to extend the A2A Registry protocol by adding an explicit dependencies field in the Agent Card. This field should allow each Agent to declare which other Agents it depends on (by description or name). \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

TaskArtifactUpdateEvent field design:\nThe Append and LastChunk fields appear to be coupled. Functionality seems achievable by removing either field. Could you clarify the specific scenario that motivated using both?\n\n2. Merging multiple Artifact-update events from the server:\n- Are the ID, Name, and Description fields determined solely by the first artifact-update?\n- How should conflicts be handled if subsequent updates include inconsistent values for these fields?\n\n3. Handling the Parts array:\nWhen should new entries be appended to the Parts array versus concatenating the content within existing Part objects?\n\n4. Streaming support in task-status-update:\n- Does task-status-update support streaming output?\n- When an agent pauses for user input (e.g., during interruptions), should the prompt be delivered via the message field in task-status-update?\n- If we wish to display such messages with a typewriter effect, what’s the recommended approach?\n\n5. Task History field origin:\nIs the Task History field composed of all message content from prior task-status-update events?\n\n6. Structure of message/stream responses:\nIs the response pattern for message/stream strictly:\n`[task-start] → [N updates] → [task-status-update (final: true)]  `\nOr are deviations possible?"

        "body": "# Description\r\n**Problem:**\r\nThe `A2AClient.send_task_streaming` method, while defined as an `async def` function and an asynchronous iterable, was internally using the synchronous `httpx.Client` and the synchronous `connect_sse` with `event_source.iter_sse()`. This caused blocking behavior when the method was awaiting network I/O for Server-Sent Events (SSE), effectively stalling the asyncio event loop from which it was called. This could prevent other asyncio tasks from running concurrently and lead to performance degradation or unexpected delays in applications relying on non-blocking operations.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nThis change refactors `send_task_streaming` to utilize `httpx.AsyncClient` along with the asynchronous `aconnect_sse` context manager and `event_source.aiter_sse()` for iterating over SSE events.\r\n\r\nThese modifications ensure that all network I/O operations within `send_task_streaming` are performed asynchronously, allowing the asyncio event loop to switch to other tasks while awaiting responses. This makes the method truly non-blocking and suitable for use in high-concurrency asyncio applications.\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n- Replaced `httpx.Client` with `httpx.AsyncClient` within `send_task_streaming`.\r\n- Replaced `connect_sse` with `aconnect_sse` for establishing the SSE connection asynchronously.\r\n- Changed the SSE iteration from `for sse in event_source.iter_sse()` to `async for sse in event_source.aiter_sse()`.\r\n\r\nThis ensures the client behaves as expected in an asynchronous environment, improving responsiveness and concurrency.\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [ ] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #<issue_number_goes_here> 🦕\r\n"

        "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the specification assumes that each agent is served from a unique base URL, effectively mapping one agent per host. However, in practice, it is common for a single host to act as a routing layer for multiple agents, each accessible via different paths under the same base URL. This setup creates the need for a standardized (open) discovery mechanism that allows clients to enumerate and resolve multiple agents served from a common origin.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI propose supporting the discovery of multiple agents under a shared base URL by leveraging the [API Catalog](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-api-catalog/08/) format defined in the corresponding Internet Draft. Specifically, a host could expose an API Catalog that lists multiple agent entries using linkset objects. Each entry would contain:\n\n - An `anchor` representing the base path for an individual agent (e.g., https://example.org/agents/agent1)\n - A `describedby` relation pointing to an Agent Card that describes the agent's capabilities, metadata, and entry points.\n\nThis approach would allow clients to dynamically discover and integrate with multiple agents hosted under a single origin, in a standardized and interoperable way.\n\nFor example, if `example.org` is hosting `agent1` and `agent2`, the expected `https://example.org/.well-known/api-catalog.json` would look like the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"linkset\": [\n    {\n      \"anchor\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent1\",\n      \"describedby\": [\n        {\n          \"href\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent1/agent.json\",\n          \"type\": \"application/json\",\n          \"title\": \"Agent Card for Agent 1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"anchor\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent2\",\n      \"describedby\": [\n        {\n          \"href\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent2/agent.json\",\n          \"type\": \"application/json\",\n          \"title\": \"Agent Card for Agent 2\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAn alternative approach discussed in the GitHub Discussion involves using a custom schema to define and expose agent API endpoint information.\n\n### Additional context\n\n - [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/google/A2A/discussions/166)\n - [GitHub Issue on A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A/issues/641)\n - [Internet-Draft api-catalog: a well-known URI and link relation to help discovery of APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-api-catalog/08/)\n - [RFC 9264 Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9264)\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Please describe.\n\n### The Need to Specify Protocol Versions Supported by the Server\nWith the recent update to the protocol version from 0.1.0 to 0.2.1, it is now possible for clients to expect certain behavior from a server that does not support the protocol version(s) the are expecting.\n\nWe need to update the Agent card to specify a list of protocol versions supported by the server.\n\nThe client should specify in the request header (X-A2A-Protocol-Version) what protocol version they are using to communicate with the server using a required request header. If this header is not present the server should reject the request with a 400 status code and a message indicating that the required request header is missing.\n\nThis will help keeps things simple for both the server and the client.\n\n### Maintaining Original Protocol Version\nAlso, if a server and the client can support communication with multiple protocol versions, the protocol version used to initiate a task or session should be used until the task is completed. The protocol versions should not change in the middle of the interaction/session.\n\nPush notifications from the server to client should always maintain the original protocol version used to estabilish the interaction and subsequent responses from the server and follow up requests from the client should also maintain the original protocol version.\n\nThe server or client should respond with a 400 or 409 status code when conflicting protocol versions are presented in the request header that differs from the original/current  protocol version\n\n### Next Steps\nI am working on a PR for this spec change\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n### Request Header from Client\n\nX-A2A-Protocol-Version: 0.2.1\n\n### Agent Card Showing Supported Protocol Version\n\n````typescript\n// An AgentCard conveys key information about an A2A Server:\n// - Overall identity and descriptive details.\n// - Service endpoint URL.\n// - Supported A2A protocol capabilities (streaming, push notifications).\n// - Authentication requirements.\n// - Default input/output content types (MIME types).\n// - A list of specific skills the agent offers.\ninterface AgentCard {\n  // Human-readable name of the agent (e.g., \"Recipe Advisor Agent\").\n  name: string;\n  // A human-readable description of the agent and its general purpose.\n  // [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text formatting.\n  // (e.g., \"This agent helps users find recipes, plan meals, and get cooking instructions.\")\n  description: string;\n  // The base URL endpoint for the agent's A2A service (where JSON-RPC requests are sent).\n  // Must be an absolute HTTPS URL for production (e.g., `https://agent.example.com/a2a/api`).\n  // HTTP MAY be used for local development/testing only.\n  url: string;\n  // Information about the organization or entity providing the agent.\n  provider?: AgentProvider;\n  // Version string for the agent or its A2A implementation\n  // (format is defined by the provider, e.g., \"1.0.0\", \"2023-10-26-beta\").\n  version: string;\n // supported protocol versions\n supportedProtocolVersions: string[];  \n// URL pointing to human-readable documentation for the agent (e.g., API usage, detailed skill descriptions).\n  documentationUrl?: string;\n  // Specifies optional A2A protocol features supported by this agent.\n  capabilities: AgentCapabilities;\n  /** Security scheme details used for authenticating with this agent. */\n  securitySchemes?: { [scheme: string]: SecurityScheme };\n  /** Security requirements for contacting the agent. */\n  security?: { [scheme: string]: string[] }[];\n  // Array of [MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)\n  // the agent generally accepts as input across all skills, unless overridden by a specific skill.\n  defaultInputModes: string[];\n  // Array of MIME types the agent generally produces as output across all skills, unless overridden by a specific skill.\n  defaultOutputModes: string[];\n  // An array of specific skills or capabilities the agent offers.\n  // Must contain at least one skill if the agent is expected to perform actions beyond simple presence.\n  skills: AgentSkill[];\n  // If `true`, the agent provides an authenticated endpoint (`/agent/authenticatedExtendedCard`)\n  // relative to the `url` field, from which a client can retrieve a potentially more detailed\n  // Agent Card after authenticating.

        "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the specification assumes that each agent is served from a unique base URL, effectively mapping one agent per host. However, in practice, it is common for a single host to act as a routing layer for multiple agents, each accessible via different paths under the same base URL. This setup creates the need for a standardized (open) discovery mechanism that allows clients to enumerate and resolve multiple agents served from a common origin.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI propose supporting the discovery of multiple agents under a shared base URL by leveraging the [API Catalog](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-api-catalog/08/) format defined in the corresponding Internet Draft. Specifically, a host could expose an API Catalog that lists multiple agent entries using linkset objects. Each entry would contain:\n\n - An `anchor` representing the base path for an individual agent (e.g., https://example.org/agents/agent1)\n - A `describedby` relation pointing to an Agent Card that describes the agent's capabilities, metadata, and entry points.\n\nThis approach would allow clients to dynamically discover and integrate with multiple agents hosted under a single origin, in a standardized and interoperable way.\n\nFor example, if `example.org` is hosting `agent1` and `agent2`, the expected `https://example.org/.well-known/api-catalog.json` would look like the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"linkset\": [\n    {\n      \"anchor\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent1\",\n      \"describedby\": [\n        {\n          \"href\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent1/agent.json\",\n          \"type\": \"application/json\",\n          \"title\": \"Agent Card for Agent 1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"anchor\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent2\",\n      \"describedby\": [\n        {\n          \"href\": \"https://example.org/agents/agent2/agent.json\",\n          \"type\": \"application/json\",\n          \"title\": \"Agent Card for Agent 2\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAn alternative approach discussed in the GitHub Discussion involves using a custom schema to define and expose agent API endpoint information.\n\n### Additional context\n\n - [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/google/A2A/discussions/166)\n - [GitHub Issue on a2a-python](https://github.com/google/a2a-python/issues/108)\n - [Internet-Draft api-catalog: a well-known URI and link relation to help discovery of APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-api-catalog/08/)\n - [RFC 9264 Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9264)\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Specifically, it would be beneficial to support the inclusion of OPENAI_URL and OPENAI_TOKEN environment variables. If these variables are present and a Gemini API key is not found, the samples should ideally default to using the specified OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

        "body": "### Problem\r\nClients need to follow up or refine previously created tasks by agents.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n**Option 1: Restartable Tasks**  \r\n\r\nAgents allow tasks to restart processing from terminal states (Completed, Failed and Cancelled).\r\n\r\nThis option focuses on reusing existing tasks by restarting them when a follow-up or refinement is requested. This simplifies agent development by maintaining local context and referencing previous tasks directly. However, it introduces complexities with parallel follow-ups, task immutability, and bookkeeping. It can also lead to inconsistencies between the client and agent's view of task history and requires the agent to manage refined artifacts and inputs.\r\n\r\n**Option 2: New Task in same contextId (Preferred)**  \r\n\r\nContext can be thought of as a larger goal from a client perspective. Clients can use the same contextId from the previous task and send a message for refinement or followup. Agents should spawn up new tasks. Tasks cannot restart processing from terminal states (Completed, Failed and Cancelled).\r\n\r\nThis approach favors creating new tasks for each follow-up or refinement while using the same `contextId`. This simplifies implementation for agents, enables parallel processing, and maintains task immutability. Clients can keep references to tasks with their state, artifacts, and messages. However, agents need to implement a strategy to infer previous tasks based on the `contextId` and handle potential ambiguities.\r\n\r\n### Other Aspects\r\n**Task Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   **App-to-Agent:** Agents infer the previous task based on the `contextId`. They may use strategies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant tasks, messages, and artifacts.\r\n*   **Agent-to-Agent:** Clients can optionally provide `referenceTaskIds` in the Message object to explicitly reference previous tasks. This acts as a hint to the serving agent.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   Agents are expected to infer the relevant artifacts based on the referred tasks. Since agents possess a deeper understanding of the tasks they have created, they are better positioned to identify the appropriate artifact for a given user message.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity about which artifact should be used for the follow-up or refinement, the agent will ask for input using `input-required`. Clients can then pass on the artifact inputs as `Parts` in the message.\r\n*   To preserve explicit linkage between inputs and previously generated artifacts, clients can optionally populate `referenceArtifactId` in the `part`'s `metadata`.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Mutation Tracking**\r\n\r\n*   A follow-up or refinement task may lead to the modification of older artifacts and the generation of new ones. While tracking all mutations of an artifact might be useful, the client is best suited to determine what constitutes the \"latest\" or intended artifact to be refined. The client ultimately decides what the result is and can reject the mutation.\r\n*   Therefore, the serving agent can choose their methodology to maintain consistency in artifact identification. Eg. it can keep the **same artifact-name** when generating a refinement on the original artifact.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity or if the context is not sufficient, the agent will utilize `input-required` to explicitly request the client to specify which artifact to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed API Change\r\n\r\n*   Addition of optional `referenceTaskIds` field in the `Message` object.\r\n*   Optional addition of `referenceArtifactId` in `part` metadata of `Message` object.\r\n"

Clients can use the same contextId from the previous task and send a message for refinement or followup. Agents should spawn up new tasks. Tasks cannot restart processing from terminal states (Completed, Failed and Cancelled).\r\n\r\nThis approach favors creating new tasks for each follow-up or refinement while using the same `contextId`. This simplifies implementation for agents, enables parallel processing, and maintains task immutability. Clients can keep references to tasks with their state, artifacts, and messages. However, agents need to implement a strategy to infer previous tasks based on the `contextId` and handle potential ambiguities.\r\n\r\n### Other Aspects\r\n**Task Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   **App-to-Agent:** Agents infer the previous task based on the `contextId`. They may use strategies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant tasks, messages, and artifacts.\r\n*   **Agent-to-Agent:** Clients can optionally provide `referenceTaskIds` in the Message object to explicitly reference previous tasks. This acts as a hint to the serving agent.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Referencing**\r\n\r\n*   Agents are expected to infer the relevant artifacts based on the referred tasks. Since agents possess a deeper understanding of the tasks they have created, they are better positioned to identify the appropriate artifact for a given user message.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity about which artifact should be used for the follow-up or refinement, the agent will ask for input using `input-required`. Clients can then pass on the artifact inputs as `Parts` in the message.\r\n*   To preserve explicit linkage between inputs and previously generated artifacts, clients can optionally populate `referenceArtifactId` in the `part`'s `metadata`.\r\n\r\n**Artifact Mutation Tracking**\r\n\r\n*   A follow-up or refinement task may lead to the modification of older artifacts and the generation of new ones. While tracking all mutations of an artifact might be useful, the client is best suited to determine what constitutes the \"latest\" or intended artifact to be refined. The client ultimately decides what the result is and can reject the mutation.\r\n*   Therefore, the serving agent can choose their methodology to maintain consistency in artifact identification. Eg. it can keep the **same artifact-name** when generating a refinement on the original artifact.\r\n*   In case of ambiguity or if the context is not sufficient, the agent will utilize `input-required` to explicitly request the client to specify which artifact to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed API Change\r\n\r\n*   Addition of optional `referenceTaskIds` field in the `Message` object.\r\n*   Optional addition of `referenceArtifactId` in `part` metadata of `Message` object.\r\n"

        "body": "Add an optional \"extensions\" property to AgentCard for listing custom API extensions.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nIt is understandable that the A2A protocol specification attempts to be as generic as possible to accommodate many agent interaction use cases. However, by not defining a way of calling custom RPC methods that developers may decide to implement on their A2A servers (to address cases not covered by the specification), the A2A protocol puts some limitations on the agentic app developers.\r\n\r\nOf course, if necessary, additional APIs can always be deployed on separate endpoints (and it makes sense for scalability). However, some developers may like the simplicity of single-endpoint deployments for their smaller agentic apps.\r\n\r\nWhile anyone can take an A2A server library and manually add their custom methods, the lack of guiding definitions in the A2A spec means that extensions developed on such forked libraries are not easily shareable with the community. Furthermore, it would add the effort overhead required for maintaining a forked version of the server library.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional property to `AgentCard` to allow listing of custom API extensions.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\nHere are some use case examples:\r\n* Perform actions on multiple tasks.\r\n* Allow clients to adjust their data and artifact retention polices.\r\n* Payment-system integrations.\r\n* Out-of-band account actions, for example, subscription upgrade with the app provider.\r\n* Give the client the ability to adjust agent behavior when processing current and future task(s), e.g., edit context data.\r\n* Run domain-specific procedures on the server.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nAn extension entry only needs to specify the \"what\" (unique `id`, `methods`) and \"where\" (`prefix`), leaving other details up to the extension developers (also allowing them to add more details as metadata).\r\n\r\nSo, the schema for an extension entry is defined as follows:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport interface AgentExtension {\r\n  /** Unique identifier of the API extension. */\r\n  id: string;\r\n  /** Human-readable name of the API extension. */\r\n  name: string;\r\n  /** Description of the API extension. */\r\n  description?: string;\r\n  /**\r\n   * Prefix added in front of the extension's JSON-RPC methods. `prefix` SHOULD NOT start with\r\n   * \"message\" or \"tasks\". It is recommended to put all extensions under a common prefix, for\r\n   * example `extensions/first/`, `extensions/second/`.\r\n   * \r\n   * Examples:\r\n   * With `prefix=extensions/taskHistory/`, an API extension method listed as `clearRecent` would\r\n   * match an RPC method registered at `extensions/taskHistory/clearRecent` on the A2A server. This\r\n   * allows supplying multiple versions of an extension.\r\n   */\r\n  prefix: string;\r\n  /** The list of method names (without prefix) provided by the API extension. */\r\n  methods: string[];\r\n  /**\r\n   * Metadata can be used to supply API-extension-specific docs, request-response schemas, and\r\n   * other relevant information.\r\n   */\r\n  metadata?: {\r\n    [key: string]: any;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example: Custom Task History Management API\r\n\r\nFor example, an extension that adds history management methods can be listed as follows:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"extensions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"TaskHistMgr-v1\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Task History Manager\",\r\n      \"description\": \"The A2A extension for managing the task history.\",\r\n      \"methods\": [\r\n        \"clearAll\",\r\n        \"clearRecent\",\r\n        \"search\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"prefix\": \"extensions/taskHistory/\",\r\n      \"metadata\": {\r\n        \"links\": [\r\n          {\"name\": \"docs\", \"href\": \"https://example-com.github.io/docs\"}\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith such an extension installed, the client, after running some mock tasks (e.g., comparing different travel plans given by the travel agent), can clean up these tasks with:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": \"39\",\r\n  \"method\": \"extensions/taskHistory/clearRecent\",\r\n  \"params\": {\r\n    \"initiatedWithinLast\": \"1 hour\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Next Steps\r\n\r\nSince the added \"extensions\" property is optional, this is a non-breaking change to the current A2A protocol. The official SDK can be updated to support his feature at a later time.\r\n\r\nOther A2A server libraries **that wish to support this option** can implement a way of registering additional RPC methods (e.g., similar to how routes are registered in WSGI and ASGI apps). For convenience, the default option for registering an extension can be set to append it to AgentCard(s) automatically. This would help with the deployment consistency for such agentic apps as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [x] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #585 🦕\r\n"

        "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the A2A specification does not provide a way to add custom methods to an A2A server. This limits the possibility of agentic apps to offer additional domain-specific features or alternative approaches to existing, more generic processes on the A2A server endpoint (same host and port).\n\n### Use cases\nHere are some use-case examples:\n* Perform actions on multiple tasks (see a more detailed history management example in the next section).\n* Allow clients to adjust their data and artifact retention polices.\n* Custom payment implementations (devs deploying agents in different countries/regions may wish to integrate local payment systems into their A2A endpoints that may not work elsewhere).\n* Out-of-band account actions, for example, subscription upgrade to resume task execution.\n* Give the client the ability to adjust agent behavior when processing future task(s).\n* Run domain-specific procedures on the server.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI propose adding an option to the A2A specification to register and serve additional API methods that are not part of the core A2A protocol, i.e., **A2A API Extensions.**\n\n### Details with an example\nThe A2A server libraries that **wish to support** this option must implement a way of registering additional RPC methods (e.g., similar to how routes are registered in WSGI and ASGI apps). Adding information about the API extensions to `AgentCard` and/or to its \"authenticated\" version would be beneficial (except for admin extensions). To enhance convenience, the default option for registering an extension can be set to append it to AgentCard(s) automatically.\n\nFor example, an extension named \"Task History Manager\" can be listed as follows in `AgentCard`:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"extensions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"TaskHistMgr-v1\",\n      \"name\": \"Task History Manager\",\n      \"description\": \"The A2A extension for managing the task history.\",\n      \"methods\": [\n        \"clearAll\",\n        \"clearRecent\",\n        \"search\"\n      ],\n      \"prefix\": \"extensions/taskHistory/\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWith such an extension installed, the client, after running some mock tasks (e.g., checking different travel plans), can clean up these tasks with:\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"d4f09e6f3a654c33af9e529d824f6836\",\n  \"method\": \"extensions/taskHistory/clearRecent\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"initiatedWithinLast\": \"1 hour\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Advantages of this solution\n* Provides a standardized approach to extend A2A server capabilities.\n* Developers working on domain-specific methods for their A2A agents would not need to maintain a custom implementation (fork) of the A2A server.\n* Since adding such extensions to existing projects would be much easier (akin to importing another library in \"pythonspeak\"), developers can collaborate more efficiently and easily share their extensions with a broader audience. Also, different teams can iterate on their extensions at their own pace.\n* For the A2A maintainers, observing which extensions are more popular within the community would be easier. It could give more confidence in recommending field-tested A2A extensions to new A2A developers. It would also be easier to see the consensus in the community regarding the usefulness of some extensions (for considering adding them into future versions of the core A2A protocol).\n* If a security vulnerability or other issues related to an extension are discovered, because individual extensions are not part of the core A2A protocol, it would be easy to update or remove that extension without the need to patch A2A server libraries.\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nCurrently, if developers want to add new API methods, they have two options (the third method in the list below is technically outside of the scope of this issue, but I put it there for completeness).\n1. If they deem the feature they are working on reasonably generic, they can try getting PRs with their methods merged into the `google/A2A` repository.\n2. Fork an A2A server implementation, e.g., the official A2A Python SDK, and modify it to meet their custom requirements.\n3. Instead of adding new methods, use additional endpoints.\n\n### Drawbacks of these alternatives\n1. One of the drawbacks of the first method is that iteration on the new feature would be slowed down by the PR review process, which could also limit the possibility for other developers to try it in their projects. Another drawback is that such features may address too specific (or diverging) concerns that may introduce too much complexity to A2A client and server libraries that do not benefit most agentic apps (and may not get widespread approval among A2A devs).\n2. While the second method allows the developers to iterate on the new feature at their pace, it has its drawbacks as well: (a) the need to maintain a custom version of the library, (b) difficulty in sharing more useful extensions with other developers, I imagine it would be more challenging if the other developers heavily rely on CI/CD that use officially supported A2A libraries.\n3. While more advanced agents may opt to expose additional methods on separate endpoints, some developers may prefer the simplicity of single-unit deployments where the agents and their accompanying methods are served from a single endpoint.\n\n### Additional context\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n**Q: Why introduce a new property instead of, for example, \"skills\"?**\nA: As far as I understand, \"skills\" aims to give an itemized summary of what the agent is configured to do, not meant for listing the API exposed to the clients.\n**Q: Then why not list extensions in \"capabilities?\"**\nA: While functionally, \"capabilities\" is closer to what the proposed \"extensions\" property is, currently, \"capabilities\" describes features of the core A2A protocol. While the \"extensions\" property is meant to list API developed and maintained outside of the A2A specification. I think it would be better not to mix these two lists.\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

        "body": "The language of the specification is unclear on exactly how SSE+Streaming should work (looking specifically at https://google.github.io/A2A/topics/streaming-and-async/ and https://google.github.io/A2A/specification/#711-tasksendparams-object).\n\nWhen calling `sendSubscribe` an SSE connection is created between the client and server.  The `TaskSendParams` includes a single message on the request.  Does this mean the SSE connection is terminated after all actions related to that message are complete (and sent back to the client)?  Or does the SSE connection remain open for the duration of the task?\n\nThe documentation says:\n\n> Initiation: The client uses the tasks/sendSubscribe RPC method to send an initial message (e.g., a prompt or command) and simultaneously subscribe to updates for that task.\n\nIf this is the case, how are subsequent messages sent from the client?  Is that done through the `tasks/send` command?  If so, is the assumption that the client should not wait for the response?"

The underlying SDK was fixed and the sample does not have the change to properly check for the `.id` property on the thread.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we fixed the `on_intermediate_message` callback as part of the Semantic Kernel agent framework, which properly emits the `FunctionCallContent` and `FunctionResultContent` during function calling. The sample is now updated to reflect this, along with updated interim messsaging to the host during function call processing.\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes a few smaller updates in the README to make sure the dev starts the host with the proper port that the SK agent server uses.\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [X] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [X] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [X] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [X] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)\r\n\r\nFixes #<issue_number_goes_here> 🦕\r\n"

This enhancement allows users to provide more context to the agent by including multiple relevant files.

This change introduces a loop that repeatedly prompts the user for file paths until an empty input is provided, collecting all specified paths. Each file is then read, base64 encoded, and added to the `message['parts']` list with the type 'file'.\r\n\r\nError handling has been added to catch `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions during file reading, ensuring that the CLI skips invalid paths and continues processing other files.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement improves the usability of the CLI for tasks that require multiple file inputs.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The current SDK demo supports Google's large model, but lacks demo examples of customizing the configuration of large models.\r\n- 3. The demo I provided, based on the standard protocol of A2A, supports custom configuration of large models and provides standard code for the agent, client, and server. \r\n- 4. I sincerely hope to provide developers who are new to the A2A project with an easy-to-get-started demo example. Therefore, if there are any parts that need to be modified, please leave a message.

I would like to have a Mesh-ID (gateway-scoped UUID) + optional DNS fallback.\nDiscovery not per GET /agent.json, but rather mDNS.\n\nThe \"agent registry\" should be a multi-tier registry: per-mesh index synced upward on a CRDT.\n\nThis means you keep a small, fast service/agent catalogue inside every local mesh, then let those catalogues gossip their changes into an eventually-consistent, global directory that is itself implemented as a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT).  Local look-ups stay LAN-fast and tolerant of partitions; the CRDT layer guarantees that all tiers will converge on the same global view without any central database or leader election, so you escape a the “single-registry bottleneck”.\n\n\n\n(Draft) - I'm gathering arguments"

Please describe.\n\nRight now, the specification seems unable to define an agent that has a type-safe interface of input and output schemas.\n\ne.g. it is loosely, or conventionally, defined at the moment.\nhttps://github.com/google/A2A/blob/c09716e0fe50fe618371f3a55d355a764006fdb3/docs/specification.md?plain=1#L1468-L1470\n\nLacking this, there's an assumption that you need inference to interpret the cards and communicate with an agent. Small models may be able to interpret the cards correctly or figure out over multiple attempts.\n\nHowever, it seems curious why the specification does not allow for type-safe agents which can be interacted with without inference interpretation.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to see a way to fully describe inputs and outputs, in the model card, without resorting to external calls to fetch json schemas. Even if the main use case is agents, having a schema makes sense for a lot of the examples, like currency exchange etc. In other words, even if it seems a goal to define agents opaquely, I think they can still be opaque in implementation without being vague or conventional in interface.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

While using `metadata` is technically possible, it lacks consistency, standardization, and discoverability.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic when:\r\n\r\n- Multiple parts of the same type are included.\r\n- Agents are designed to consume named parameters of the same type (e.g., `query: str` and `context: str`)\r\n- Parts are dynamically generated by the request sender or appear in variable order.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution:\r\n\r\nIntroducing a dedicated `name` field provides a standardized, first-class way to label parts. This is more explicit, easier to validate, and more consistent across implementations than using `metadata`. It also helps avoid mismatches between clients and agents, and makes it simpler for task managers to map parts to agent invocation inputs.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details:\r\n\r\n- Updated JSON schema definitions to include an optional name field in each Part type.\r\n- Ensured backward compatibility by making the field optional.\r\n- Updated the protocol documentation to reflect the new `name` field and its usage.\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Improved clarity in `Part`s structures\r\n- Enables request parts validation\r\n\r\nFixes #461 "

        "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nYes. When using the A2A protocol to send tasks with multiple `Part` elements in a message (e.g., a `TextPart` for a query and a `FilePart` for an image), there is currently no standardized way to name or label these parts. This leads to ambiguity and requires agents to rely on the order of parts or use informal conventions via metadata to interpret inputs correctly.\n\nThis becomes especially problematic when:\n\n- Multiple parts of the same type are sent (e.g., several `TextPart`s),\n- Agents are built to work with named parameters and some may have the same type (e.g., `query: str`, `channel: str`),\n- Parts are dynamically generated or added in variable order,\n- Developers want to build stricter contracts or validation logic for agent inputs.\n\nWhile it is possible to include a name or similar identifier in the `metadata` field of each part, this approach lacks consistency and discoverability. Having a dedicated `name` field would make input handling clearer, easier to validate.\n\nWithout a naming mechanism, the protocol lacks a robust way to map inputs to their intended semantic meaning.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to propose extending the Part model (e.g., `TextPart`, `FilePart`, etc.) to optionally include a `name: str `field.\n\nThis would allow each part to be explicitly labeled (e.g., `name=\"query\"`, `name=\"invoice\"`) and give agents a consistent and reliable way to reference expected inputs.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nparts: [\n\n   {\n     \"type\": \"text\",\n     \"text\": \"What's the total from this invoice?\",\n     \"name\": \"query\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"type\": \"file\",\n     \"file\": {\n          \"mimeType\": \"application/pdf\",\n          \"bytes\": \"<base64-encoded-content>\",\n     },\n     \"name\": \"invoice\"\n   }\n]\n```\n\nThis change would improve readability and debuggability, reduce reliance on ordering, enable stronger validation and agent design and be backward-compatible if name is made optional.\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAs mentioned above, part names can be added to `metadata` field, but this is inconsistent and not standardized. A dedicated `name` field would make input handling clearer and validation more straightforward.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

In this example, Restate acts as a scalable, resilient task orchestrator that speaks the A2A protocol and gives you a lot of resiliency features: retries, recovery, task control, idempotency, etc. \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nBelow are the most important changes:\r\n\r\n* Created a `README.md` for the Restate reimbursement agent, explaining its features, prerequisites, setup instructions, and usage.\r\n* Added `__main__.py` to serve the Restate reimbursement agent as an A2A server.\r\n* Implemented the Restate equivalent of the A2A server and task manager in `middleware.py`\r\n* Implemented the core logic of the Restate agent in `agent.py`. This agent is identical to the Google ADK example. But now fully resilient.\r\n\r\n## How to run?\r\n\r\nSee example readme.\r\n\r\n**Note**: I ran the nox formatter which caused some tool parameters (`create_request_form`) to change from `Optional[str]` to `str | None` causing issues with the LLM calls. This also persists with the pure Google ADK example (https://github.com/google/A2A/issues/422) Therefore, I reverted those types to `Optional[str]`."

This system addresses key security challenges in agent-to-agent communication through several critical mechanisms.\r\n\r\n## Key Security Features\r\n1. **Identity Verification**: Agents can cryptographically prove their identity using blockchain-based fingerprints, preventing impersonation attacks.\r\n\r\n2. **Message Integrity**: The system signs messages to ensure they haven't been tampered with during transmission, adding a layer of verification beyond basic transport security.\r\n\r\n3. **Decentralized Trust**: By using blockchain for verification, the system leverages decentralized trust rather than relying solely on centralized certificate authorities.\r\n\r\n4. **Enhanced Authentication**: The fingerprinting system extends A2A's authentication schemes with cryptographic proof, complementing existing methods like bearer tokens.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with A2A Goals\r\n- Supports the protocol's mission of secure cross-framework agent communication\r\n- Adds a verification layer for agent identity in line with enterprise security needs\r\n- Provides a flexible implementation that works with multiple blockchain networks\r\n- Extends A2A's agent card specification with fingerprint metadata\r\n\r\n## Implementation Approach\r\nThe implementation integrates seamlessly by extending existing client classes and following A2A's modular architecture, making it an opt-in feature that preserves backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nAdd a secure fingerprinting system to enhance A2A protocol authentication with:\r\n- Blockchain-based identity verification for agents\r\n- Cryptographic message integrity checks\r\n- Multi-chain verification support\r\n- Flexible validation mechanisms\r\n\r\nImplementation includes:\r\n- Fingerprint types and models\r\n- Generation and validation modules\r\n- A2A client integration\r\n- Unit tests\r\n\r\nBased on the dfdumaresq/Fingerprint project.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThank you for opening a Pull Request!\r\nBefore submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [`CONTRIBUTING` Guide](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] Make your Pull Request title in the <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> specification.\r\n- [x] Ensure the tests and linter pass (Run `nox -s format` from the repository root to format)\r\n- [x] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)"

An Agentic Profile lists AI agents that represent the entity, along with information about the agent such as service endpoints and authentication schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Decentralized Authentication\r\n\r\nBy default, the Agentic Profile supports decentralized authentication using JWT and public key cryptography.  Each agent listed in the DID document under the **service** property can provide **capabilityInvocation** information.  This information can include a named public key, or a reference to a named public key.\r\n\r\nWhen an agent is challenged, the agent uses its private key to create a JWT which includes both the challenge, and the agent's DID+agent id.  For example the DID did:web:example.com:iam:mike#coder would represent the DID document at https://example.com/iam/mike/did.json and the agent with the id \"#coder\" in the documents \"service\" list.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does the Agentic Profile integrate with A2A?\r\n\r\nEach A2A agent is listed in the **service** array property of the Agentic Profile/DID document using the following conventions:\r\n\r\n- The **serviceEndpoint** property is a URL to the A2A agent (when not ending in / or agent.json), or the agent card (when ending in / or agent.json)\r\n- The service **type** is A2A"

        "body": "# Protocol updates\r\n\r\nThis PR makes some clarifications around several concepts and intends to make simple 'chit-chat' like scenarios, or stateless interactions, easier. In particular:\r\n\r\n- Introduces a messageId that is created by the message creator (both client and server)\r\n- Clarifies the ownership of a taskId. This is always determined by the server (if/when a task is needed). Client should send follow up messages with the relevant taskId to continue interactions around an existing task\r\n- Changes the name 'sessionId' to 'contextId' and allows it to be attached to messages and tasks. The server is responsible for creating the contextId and the client is responsible for using it to continue interactions with shared context.\r\n- Introduces a new message/send endpoint. This is parallel to the task/send endpoint (which is deprecated as of this PR and will be removed in a future PR). This endpoint returns either a Message object (if there is not state/task to track) or a task object. If the request is blocking, it will only return when the task is in a suspended state. If the request is non-blocking, it will return the status of the initial task creation. The client can then poll for task updates.\r\n- Introduces a new message/stream endpoint. This is parallel to the task/sendSubscribe endpoint (which is deprecated as of this PR and will be removed in a future PR). The endpoint has the following expectations:\r\n   - If the response is a simple Message with no statefulness, returns a Message and the channel should be closed.\r\n   - Otherwise, the first thing returned is an initial task object with the 'submitted' state. Each subsequent event is a TaskStatusUpdateEvent or TaskArtifactUpdateEvent until the final TaskStatusUpdateEvent is received.\r\n\r\nThe demo UI app and the cli app have been updated to use the new endpoints, and no longer use the old ones. The biggest delta is that the new endpoints create the task and context identifiers when the remote agent deems it necessary, and the client is not responsible (nor should) generate these itself. Also, all messages are required to have a messageId with a value created by the sender. To continue a multi-turn interaction the same contextId must be used in subsequent messages send from the client to the server. To continue an interaction within the scope of a task, the contextId and taskId must be included in the message sent from the client."

        "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nAFAIK, there are (at least) 4 ways to implement user confirmations for agents:\n1. Agent uses a out-of-band channel it already has with the user. Example: a bank agent may already have a preliminary relationship with a user, thru their smartphone; and thus can prompt a user for confirmation thru this existing secure channel.\n2. Agent uses an enterprise [enforcement endpoint](https://github.com/google/A2A/issues/387), which has a mechanism to prompt the user - again, out of band.\n3. Agent uses an \"in-band\" confirmation mechanism. The agent essentially indicates to the caller (which itself may be an agent) that it requires user confirmation. The confirmation request gets propagated back to the agent calls stack until it reaches the user. a2a specs support a \"input-required\" state for this, but afaik, there's no guarantee the legitimate user confirmed: the confirmation may be subject to prompt injection or a middle agent box may reply instead.\n4. Hybrid in-band. Same as (3), but the reply from the user is not in-band. Instead, the agent's confirmation request is a link that the user clicks. So the user confirmation itself is out-of-band, similar to (1). This may be achievable using [OAuth RFC 9470](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9470/) and [MCP's userInteraction](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/475).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nFor (3) (and maybe (4)), we may require stronger security guarantees (confidentiality, integrity, non-replay) that the user indeed confirmed.\nSome directions:\n\n* Encrypted tunnel (There are known ways to do this. e.g., Sign+Mac, IEEE, Noise, etc). The user's client establishes a secure channel with the agent that requires confirmation.\n* Hybrid encryption (aka Sign + encrypt) with a unique ID in the message (to protect against replay attacks). There are known ways to do this. (If confidentiality is not a problem, signing is enough).\n* Maybe others?\n\nThe user requires some pub key to make the above possible. This could simply be an ephemeral key created for a given session / task (details TBD) by the client software. With the above mechanism in place, the agent can have proof that the user who initiated the session has confirmed the message: when receiving a confirmation request, the user would be prompted to manually confirm (What the exact UI looks like is out of scope of a2a, iiuc).\n\nIf a middle agent's box is compromised zo, there is still a risk that it would allow an attacker to provide an arbitrary pub key under their control and forge the confirmation message. There are (at least) 2 options here:\n\n* We never give an oauth token (with the relevant scopes) to middle boxes / agents for actions that require user confirmation. Then the token can be sent thru the the encrypted channel. Today, I don't think oauth tokens are granular enough to separate scopes that would require user confirmation vs. those that do not. Another limitation is that the confirmation needs to be a predefined decision (can't be dynamically decided at runtime based on other security signals) - that may be fine for many use cases.\n* We bind the user identity to the user's pub key. For example: if the agent requiring user confirmation is a bank, this pub key should be bound to the user's account / identity with the bank. Oauth has support for something like this (called [DPOP](https://oauth.net/2/dpop/)). At a high-level, it adds a user pub key inside the oauth token. The bank would only accept pub key that matches the identity of the user who needs to confirm (which it finds in the oath token used for authn). I'm not aware of oauth providers supporting this feature atm.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Please describe.\n\nThere is no standard way for agents to label their responses (text and other artifacts) to indicate whether it contains data that needs to be kept private (e.g., PII, NTK, user data, etc) or may alter the agent's behavior (e.g., untrusted data which may lead to prompt injection). Google workspace API, for example, can return metadata about documents and an agent could use that to populate such fields. This sort of metadata is useful to enforce policies on data flow (including propagating that information in longer-lived agentic memory) and possibly for logging too.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGiven the the specs already support a metadata field , it may be useful to standardize a naming convention for the annotation, with the aim to make them interoperable across agents and to avoid name collisions. Support for custom labels would be useful too.\nA simple idea could be to use the agent's domain as the key to the annotation: e.g., `company.com/a2a/annotations/<custom_key>` and define a list common keys under `a2a.dev/annotations/<key>` like `a2a.dev/annotations/pii`\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Please describe.\n\nThe problem is that agents need to be told which other agents they can talk to.\nAgent card is nice declarative info about the agent, but it does not solve discovery.\nFor agent fleet, we need to either use private registry, or tell agent explicitly which agents are available.\nThis adds inconsistency and extra complexity.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n## discovery on local machine\nUse [mDNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762) / DNS-SD (Multicast DNS / DNS-Based Service Discovery)\n\nTechnology behind Apple's Bonjour and Zeroconf. Instead of relying on a central DNS server, devices use special multicast addresses (like 224.0.0.251 for IPv4) to send DNS-like queries and announcements directly to all other devices on the same local network link. DNS-SD builds on mDNS to allow services to advertise not just their name/IP but also their type, port, and other metadata (using TXT records).\n\n- An A2A agent starts up and advertises a service, for example, named MyAgent of type _a2a._tcp.local running on port 8080\n- Another agent wanting to discover peers browses for services of type _a2a._tcp.local. It receives responses from advertising agents, learning their names, IP addresses, ports, and any TXT record data. It can then connect and fetch the Agent Card.\n\n\n## k8s agent discovery\n- An agent could query the Kubernetes API (if granted permissions) to list Services within its namespace that have a specific label (e.g., app: `a2a-agent`). \n- Once a service endpoint (IP/port) is found, the agent could attempt to fetch the Agent Card from the standard /.well-known/agent.json path on that endpoint or a pre-agreed port.\n\n## Suggested changes\n- In [agent capabilities](https://google.github.io/A2A/specification/agent-card/#representation), add `autodiscovery` as agent ability\n- add standard recomendation for auto-discovery \n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

        "body": "### What happened?\n\n\n\n**What happened?**\n\nWhen using an A2A agent based on `InMemoryTaskManager` for streaming responses (`on_send_task_subscribe`), the agent correctly sends status updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) using `enqueue_events_for_sse`. It sends a final event marked with `final=True` indicating the concluding state of that interaction step (e.g., `INPUT_REQUIRED` or `COMPLETED`).\n\nHowever, the act of calling `enqueue_events_for_sse` does not automatically update the task's state within the `InMemoryTaskManager`'s internal storage (`self.tasks`). If the client, after receiving the final SSE event, subsequently calls the `get_task` method, the agent retrieves the task state from `self.tasks`, which may still hold an earlier, outdated state (e.g., `SUBMITTED` or `WORKING`). This leads to an inconsistency where the state reported by `get_task` does not match the final state communicated via the SSE stream.\n\n**What you expected to happen and how to reproduce the issue:**\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe task state returned by a `get_task` call made after the SSE stream has concluded (i.e., after the `final=True` event was sent) should be consistent with the state indicated in that final SSE event. The agent's internal task record should be updated synchronously when the final status event is prepared and enqueued.\n\n**How to Reproduce:**\n1.  Create an A2A agent using `google-a2a-common` with `InMemoryTaskManager` and implement the `on_send_task_subscribe` method for streaming.\n2.  Within the streaming logic (e.g., a helper function called by `on_send_task_subscribe`), use `enqueue_events_for_sse` to send one or more status updates, culminating in a final event with a specific state (e.g., `TaskState.INPUT_REQUIRED`) and `final=True`. **Crucially, do not manually update the state of the task object stored in `self.tasks` at this point.**\n3.  Create an A2A client that connects to this agent.\n4.  The client should call `send_task_streaming` and iterate through the received SSE events, logging their content.\n5.  Immediately after the `async for` loop processing the SSE events finishes, the client should call `get_task` using the same `taskId`.\n6.  Compare the state reported in the last logged SSE event (`final=True`) with the state reported in the result of the `get_task` call.\n\n**Relevant log output:**\n\n```\n# Client Output Example\n[...]\nstream event => {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"b77da65222224ec5b1251f2a4c19763c\",\"result\":{\"id\":\"29d7fd86d0f34b70b73dfd1ca2664175\",\"status\":{\"state\":\"working\",\"message\":{...}},\"final\":false}}\nstream event => {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"b77da65222224ec5b1251f2a4c19763c\",\"result\":{\"id\":\"29d7fd86d0f34b70b73dfd1ca2664175\",\"status\":{\"state\":\"input-required\",\"message\":{...}},\"final\":true}}\n# <-- SSE stream ends here -->\n# Client calls get_task({\"id\": \"29d7fd86d0f34b70b73dfd1ca2664175\"})\n# Client prints state from get_task result:\nTask state: SUBMITTED\n```\n*(Note the discrepancy: stream ended with `input-required`, but `get_task` returned `SUBMITTED`)*\n\n---\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nThe responsibility for maintaining the consistency between the state sent via SSE and the state stored internally lies within the custom `TaskManager` implementation. The `InMemoryTaskManager` (and potentially the base `TaskManager` interface or documentation) should clarify this.\n\nA robust solution requires the agent developer to explicitly update the internal task state *before* or *at the same time* as enqueuing the final SSE event.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nIn the custom `TaskManager` inheriting from `InMemoryTaskManager`:\n\n1.  Implement a helper method (e.g., `_update_task_status`) that takes a `task_id`, a new `TaskState`, and potentially a `Message`, and updates the corresponding `Task` object within the `self.tasks` dictionary.\n    ```python\n    async def _update_task_status(self, task_id: str, new_state: TaskState, message: Message | None = None):\n        if task_id in self.tasks:\n            task = self.tasks[task_id]\n            task.status.state = new_state\n            if message:\n                task.status.message = message\n            # task.status.timestamp updates automatically\n            # Update artifacts if it's a terminal state\n            if new_state in [TaskState.COMPLETED, TaskState.FAILED]:\n                 task.artifacts = [Artifact(parts=message.parts if message else [])]\n            else:\n                 task.artifacts = [] # Clear artifacts for non-terminal states\n            # self.tasks[task_id] = task # Not needed if task is mutated in place\n            logger.info(f\"Updated internal state for task {task_id} to {new_state.name}\")\n        else:\n            logger.error(f\"Attempted to update status for non-existent task: {task_id}\")\n\n    ```\n2.  In the streaming logic (e.g., `_stream_messages_logic`, `on_send_task_subscribe`), just before calling `enqueue_events_for_sse` for an event where `final=True`, call this helper method to update the internal state first.\n\n    ```python\n    # Example within streaming logic:\n    # ... preparing final status ...\n    final_state = TaskState.INPUT_REQUIRED\n    final_message = Message(role=\"agent\", parts=[TextPart(text=\"More input needed?\")])\n\n    # 1. Update internal state FIRST\n    await self._update_task_status(task_id, final_state, final_message)\n\n    # 2. Prepare and enqueue the SSE event using the updated status\n    task_status = self.tasks[task_id].status # Get the updated status\n    task_update_event = TaskStatusUpdateEvent(\n        id=task_id,\n        status=task_status,\n        final=True,\n    )\n    await self.enqueue_events_for_sse(task_id, task_update_event)\n    ```\n\nThis ensures that when `get_task` is called after the stream finishes, it reads the correctly updated state from `self.tasks`, maintaining consistency with the final SSE event sent. Documentation and examples should emphasize this required step for robust state management in streaming scenarios.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

In particular, the schema allows requests and responses without \"jsonrpc\" and \"id\" properties. The latter one is particularly important because it is the value that allows peers to correlate responses to the requests. For example, here's how `CancelTaskRequest` is currently defined:\n```json\n{\n     ...\n      \"CancelTaskRequest\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"jsonrpc\": {\n            \"const\": \"2.0\",\n            \"default\": \"2.0\",\n            \"title\": \"Jsonrpc\",\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"id\": {\n            \"anyOf\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"integer\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Id\"\n          },\n          \"method\": {\n            \"const\": \"tasks/cancel\",\n            \"default\": \"tasks/cancel\",\n            \"title\": \"Method\",\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"params\": {\n            \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/TaskIdParams\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\n          \"method\",\n          \"params\"\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"CancelTaskRequest\",\n        \"type\": \"object\"\n      },\n     ...\n}\n```\n**It validates against requests that do not contain the \"id\" field.**\n\nAlso, the \"jsonrpc\" property should not have the default value present in the schema. I believe it is a consequence of schemas with fields defined as with `... = [default value or factory]` being generated from pydantic models, e.g.:\n```python\nclass MyModel(BaseModel):\n    field1: [type] = [default value or factory]\n```\n\nP.S. Also, see a [comment](https://github.com/google/A2A/pull/271#issuecomment-2825087251) that explains unnecessary \"null\" types that were also likely caused by the left-hand side of `field: str | None = None`. I know that the \"null-types\" issue was recently resolved; this is a different issue.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Please describe.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nHi, everyone!\n\nOur team @ LATAM Airlines has been working on developing agents and agent-to-agent communication for a while, and one of the needs we identified was sharing artifacts between agents. \n\nAn agent could leverage an artifact generated by another agent for its operation. Say, for example, you've got an image generation agent for a specific use case (e.g. marketing) called Marketing Agent, and another agent in charge of handling a social network account like a company's LinkedIn Profile, called LinkedIn Agent. A reasonable use case would be to use both agents through an orchestrator and ask to generate LinkedIn posts with images based on natural language prompts. The LinkedIn agent would require an image as input, which the orchestrator would provide after asking the Marketing Agent to generate it. We've identified many other use cases that require agents to receive artifacts as inputs, preprocess them, and use them as arguments for different tools or as inputs to LLMs.\n\nAn Artifact on the TaskSendParams is not particularly needed to accomplish this: one could copy the parts of the Artifact on a Message object and send that, and the A2A Server would receive all it needs. However, it would be beneficial if the Artifact object remained immutable when forwarded to another Agent for traceability, observability, and monitoring purposes. That way, one could trace which agents used the same Artifact as input, or the whole lifespan of an Artifact as shared by the orchestrator or other agents.\n\nIt would also be useful for implementing something like an Artifact Store. If the same Artifact object representing an agent's result was shared between multiple agents, these objects could all point to the same object on a remote Artifact Store, which would act as a central repository for all artifacts generated by agents on a multi-agent system.\n\nI would like to know your thoughts on this!\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct"

Fully complying with the standards can help validate the payloads more accurately and help better test different client and server implementations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the A2A spec more compliant with the mentioned standards, changes in this PR are meant to fix a few minor bugs in the A2A protocol spec (mismatches from what was implemented in the sample A2A server and clients.\r\n\r\nAddresses issue #353.\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n* Makes field \"id\" required on requests and responses. This field is important because, according to the JSON RPC 2.0 spec, a message that does not have an \"id\" is considered a notification, and the callee does not have to send a response to such requests. Similarly, without the \"id\" on the responses, the caller cannot correlate the responses to the pending requests, meaning that fully JSON-RPC-compliant clients would not be able to resolve such RPC calls.\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Edit: clearer wording + add issue references*\r\n\r\n*Edit2: the scope of this PR has been reduced due to other updates fixing parts of the spec, summary items were edited to reflect what has already been addressed in other PRs.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## (OLD) Summary of changes\r\n\r\n* Add a missing definition for \"TaskSendParams.acceptedOutputModes\" (described in #354). Fixed in #599.\r\n\r\n* Remove \"default\" values for \"const\" fields. Compliance with JSON schema, version `>=draft-6` and reduce ambiguity. https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/const\r\nFixed in #599\r\n\r\n* Make fields \"jsonrpc\" and \"id\" required on requests and responses. Compliance with JSON-RPC 2.0.\r\n\r\n* Make fields \"error.code\" and \"error.message\" required on errors. Fixed in #599.\r\n\r\n* In a few places, sort non-top-level dict keys to make them more aligned with the pydantic JSON schema outputs. Since now, we are discouraged from editing the spec manually, this item also drops out of the scope of our concerns.\r\n\r\n* The initial commit in this PR also included cleaning up several unnecessary \"null\" types, which were addressed more thoroughly in #352.\r\n\r\n## (OLD) Additional notes\r\n\r\nWhile I sorted dictionaries within each model so that the keys of each model would be in the same order as the pydantic-based scripts' exports, at the same time, **I decided not to sort the top-level keys** (`$defs/ModelKey`). Because doing so would make the diff ugly and harder to read the applied changes. The top-level key sorting can be done afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE\r\nfix!: Resolve spec inconsistencies with JSON-RPC 2.0\r\nEND_COMMIT_OVERRIDE\r\n"

Obviously not according to the expected outputs. Why do either of those changes? \n\nThis then leads to a confusion on the indentation, and the general workflow of the entire method since the async for loop actually only extends to the end of the TaskStatusUpdateEvent such that the message for input required is outside the loop. \n\n```python\n    task_update_event = TaskStatusUpdateEvent(\n        id=request.params.id,\n        status=task_status,\n        final=False,\n    )\n# HERE\nask_message = Message(\n    role=\"agent\",\n    parts=[\n        {\n            \"type\": \"text\",\n            \"text\": \"Would you like more messages? (Y/N)\"\n        }\n    ]\n)\n```"

        "body": "**Problem:**\n\nClients retrieving task history via `tasks/get` with `historyLength` receive an array of `Message` objects. These `Message` objects lack timestamps, making it impossible for clients (especially those not using SSE or experiencing disconnects) to reliably render a chronologically accurate conversation log (e.g., a chat UI) with timings for each turn. The `Task.status.timestamp` only reflects the *latest* status change.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nIntroduce a new _optional_ parameter object to the `tasks/get` method: `statusHistoryRequest?: { since?: string; count?: number }`.\n\n*   `since`: An optional ISO 8601 timestamp string. If provided, the server should return status history entries *equal to or newer than* this timestamp.\n*   `count`: An optional integer. If provided, the server should limit the number of returned status history entries to the most recent `count` entries that meet the `since` criteria (if provided).\n\nWhen a client includes the `statusHistoryRequest` parameter in a `tasks/get` request, the server should return a new optional field in the result: `statusHistory: TaskStatus[]`.\n\n```typescript\n// tasks/get request params modification\ninterface TaskGetParams {\n  id: string;\n  historyLength?: number; // Existing parameter\n  statusHistoryRequest?: { // <<< NEW Optional Parameter Object\n    since?: string;        // ISO8601 datetime string\n    count?: number;        // Max number of *most recent* entries to return\n  };\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>;\n}\n\n// tasks/get response modification\ninterface TaskGetResponse { // Assuming this structure exists implicitly\n  id: string;\n  sessionId?: string;\n  status: TaskStatus; // The current/latest status\n  artifacts?: Artifact[];\n  history?: Message[]; // Existing history (remains unchanged)\n  statusHistory?: TaskStatus[]; // <<< NEW: Array of historical TaskStatus objects\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>;\n}\n```\n\nThe `statusHistory` array would contain recorded `TaskStatus` updates for the task, **ordered chronologically (oldest first, newest last)**. This ordering is natural for displaying sequences of events over time.\n\n*   If only `since` is provided, return all entries from that time forward, ordered oldest to newest.\n*   If only `count` is provided, return the latest `count` entries, ordered oldest to newest.\n*   If both `since` and `count` are provided, return the latest `count` entries *since* the specified timestamp, ordered oldest to newest.\n*   If neither `since` nor `count` is provided within `statusHistoryRequest`, the server *may* choose a default behavior (e.g., return the latest entry, or a default count, ordered chronologically) or return an empty array/omit the field. Explicitly providing at least one is recommended for predictable results.\n\nEach `TaskStatus` object includes the `state`, the `timestamp` of that status change, and potentially the `message` associated with that change. The `status` field at the top level of the response *always* reflects the absolute latest status of the task, regardless of the filters applied to `statusHistory`.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Provides Timestamps:** Directly addresses the need for timestamps associated with historical events/messages.\n*   **Chronological Ordering:** Returns history in a natural order for UI rendering (oldest first).\n*   **Flexible Querying:** Allows clients to fetch history incrementally (`since`) or get recent context (`count`).\n*   **Backwards Compatible:** Introduces a new parameter object and response field. Existing clients are unaffected. Servers only need to implement this if they support it.\n*   **Leverages Existing Structures:** Reuses the defined `TaskStatus` interface.\n*   **Alignment with Capability:** Provides a concrete and flexible mechanism for agents advertising `capabilities.stateTransitionHistory: true`.\n\n**Example Request (Fetch since a specific time):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\":\"tasks/get\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"id\": \"de38c76d-d54c-436c-8b9f-4c2703648d64\",\n    \"statusHistoryRequest\": {\n      \"since\": \"2025-04-18T10:00:30Z\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Request (Fetch latest 5 entries):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\":\"tasks/get\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"id\": \"de38c76d-d54c-436c-8b9f-4c2703648d64\",\n    \"statusHistoryRequest\": {\n      \"count\": 5\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Response Snippet (Illustrative content based on request 1, showing oldest first):**\n\n```js\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1, // Corresponds to the first example request\n  \"result\": {\n    \"id\": \"de38c76d-d54c-436c-8b9f-4c2703648d64\",\n    // ... other fields ...\n    \"statusHistory\": [ // Ordered oldest first\n       {\n        \"state\": \"working\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-18T10:00:35Z\" // Older entry >= 'since'\n      },\n      {\n        \"state\": \"input-required\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-18T10:01:00Z\", // Newer entry >= 'since'\n        \"message\": { \"role\": \"agent\", \"parts\": [...] }\n      }\n      // Potentially more entries... up to the current time\n    ],\n    \"status\": { // Current status *always* reflects the latest actual status\n      \"state\": \"input-required\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-18T10:01:00Z\",\n      \"message\": { \"role\": \"agent\", \"parts\": [...] }\n    }\n    // ... other fields like artifacts ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach offers enhanced flexibility for retrieving timed history while maintaining compatibility and leveraging existing protocol structures."

  *   Tests saving a task and then retrieving it successfully by its ID.\n    *   Tests deleting a saved task prevents subsequent retrieval.\n    *   Tests saving and retrieving push notification configuration associated with a task ID.\n    *   Tests that retrieving push notification config for a task without one returns nothing.\n    *   Tests saving multiple state updates for a task and retrieving the ordered history.\n    *   Tests retrieving state history for a task that never had any returns an empty list.\n\n**Task Service Logic**\n\n*   `task_service_test.rs`\n    *   Verifies processing a valid task request saves the task and returns it (mock completes immediately).\n    *   Verifies tasks sent with specific IDs, sessions, and metadata are persisted correctly.\n    *   Verifies sending a follow-up to a task not in `InputRequired` state returns an error.\n    *   Verifies retrieving an existing task by ID returns the correct data.\n    *   Verifies retrieving a non-existent task by ID returns a `TaskNotFound` error.\n    *   Verifies canceling a 'Working' task correctly transitions its state to 'Canceled'.\n    *   Verifies attempting to cancel an already 'Completed' task returns a `TaskNotCancelable` error.\n    *   Verifies sending a follow-up message to an 'InputRequired' task transitions it towards completion.\n    *   Verifies retrieving the state

is able to connect A2A requests to MCP's -- essentially allowing A2A to be an easy-to-setup wrapper for mcp servers.\n\nI think this will drive adoption -- especially when payment schemes can be added so companies have an incentive to implement A2A services."

The notification receiver will always reply with the validation token and thus the agent will send it further notifications.\n\n\nAnother potential attack vector is the use of error messages returned by agent to client. An attacker may submit arbitrary URLs to the agent in an attempt to identify internal domains / IPs that exist within the local network the agent runs on (internal enterprise network). Example: for a given push notification URL, the agent may return \"domain not available\" or \"failed token verification\" which would allow to distinguish and start mapping an internal network. The current samples are not vulnerable to this afaict since the exceptions are caught and only logged, but another implementation may make this mistake.

However, requiring users/agents to manage separate payment accounts for *every* provider creates significant friction, hindering the vision of a seamless agent web.\n\nHow can the protocol facilitate monetization *without* becoming overly complex, especially early on?\n\n**Conceptual Ideas:**\n\n1.  **Auth Token = Billing Key:** Use existing auth; providers handle billing externally. (Simple, but doesn't solve the user's multi-provider hassle).\n2.  **Metadata Payment Info:** Agents include standard payment pointers/invoices in `Task.metadata` upon completion. (Low protocol impact, relies on client agents to handle payment, post-pay risk).\n3.  **Metadata Credits:** Pass verifiable credit tokens (from trusted issuers) in `metadata`. (Low-medium impact, starts solving user hassle, needs issuer ecosystem).\n4.  **Formal Pricing/Commitment:** Add `pricing` to `AgentSkill`, pass payment proof (`commitmentToken`) in requests. (Medium impact, schema change, better provider assurance).\n5.  **Formal Metering/Escrow:** More complex protocol extensions for detailed billing or secure escrow flows. (High impact, significant complexity).\n\n**Key Trade-off:** Balancing ease of adoption (simpler protocol) vs. solving the user's cross-provider payment problem more directly.\n\n**Proposal for Initial Steps:**\n\n*   Acknowledge **option 1** as the baseline.\n*   Promote **option 2 (Metadata Payment Info)** as the least disruptive *first step*. It allows experimentation and client-side payment abstraction using existing standards, without immediate, complex protocol changes.\n*   View **option 4 (Formal Pricing)** and others as potential *future* enhancements once the protocol gains traction.\n\nThis prioritizes adoption while offering a flexible path forward via metadata.\n\n**Questions for Discussion:**\n\n*   Is this the right initial balance?\n*   Are metadata-based approaches sufficient for now?\n*   What are the priorities for monetization support?\n\nLooking forward to community input!

Fixed type errors in agent implementations:\r\n   - Added missing `type: \"text\"` property to message parts in both agents\r\n   - Fixed type definitions for message parts in error and status messages\r\n\r\nThese changes improve type safety and configuration management in the agent modules."

Here are some questions I have that I don't think are currently answered:\n\n1. First off, are names for Artifacts unique in the scope of a Task? Are indexes unique? Is it allowed in the spec to have two Artifacts in a Task with the same name but different indexes? Conversely, is it allowed in the spec to have two Artifacts in a Task with different names but the same index?\n2. Assuming that index is unique in the scope of a Task, what do you do when a TaskArtifactUpdateEvent sends a new `name` for the Artifact? Does it overwrite the previous name? Is it an error? Or is it ignored? Similarly, is a new `description` for the Artifact an overwrite/error/ignored?\n3. When you send metadata in a TaskArtifactUpdateEvent, does it replace the existing metadata for the Artifact, or is it merged into the existing metadata for the Artifact on a field-by-field basis, or is it an error, or is it ignored?\n4. How do `append` and `lastChunk` work in practice? A few examples that I'm unsure about:\n    1. Let's say you send one update with `append: false` and `lastChunk: false`, and then send a second update again with `append: false` and `lastChunk: false`. Intuitively, I would think that this wipes out and overwrites the first update. Is that correct, or is this an error?\n    2. Now, let's say you send several updates in a row with `append: true` and `lastChunk: false`. Then you send an update with `append: true` and `lastChunk: true`. Finally you send an update with `append: true` and `lastChunk:false`. Is that an error?\n    3. Similar to the last one,  let's say you send several updates in a row with `append: true` and `lastChunk: false`. Then you send an update with `append: true` and `lastChunk: true`. Finally you send an update with `append: false` and `lastChunk:false`. Is that an error or does it wipe out all the previous updates?\n\nI know that some of these may seem like nitpicks, but I tend to think a spec should be really clear about error cases and state transitions. I think in it's current state, a reasonable engineer could assume several different ways this artifact update mechanism works."

(For example client: \"draw a picture of a rabbit\", agent: \"<picture>\", client: \"make it red\"). - very confused, how to make this?\n\nI don't really understand even if I played around with the simple demo, I couldn't get the point like how to reject the request? like how to delegate to other agents and systems? And \"the client can request more information or a change in the context of that same Task\". \n\nFrom the python samples, I didn't really find any related code or so, so I posted here see if anyone could help me ;)"

        "body": "Reading over the technical documentation, I'm a bit confused as to what the `id` field is supposed to mean in the TaskArtifactUpdateEvent. The definition of the object reads:\n\n```typescript\n// sent by server during sendSubscribe or subscribe requests\ninterface TaskArtifactUpdateEvent {\n  id: string;\n  artifact: Artifact;\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>;\n}\n````\n\nI was a little confused what `id` was doing there, as Artifacts don't seem to have an ID, but then I figured that `id` must be the ID of the task that the Artifact is associated with. Makes sense. But then I got to the streaming example, and it looks like this:\n\n```typescript\n//Request\n{\n  \"method\":\"tasks/sendSubscribe\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"id\": \"de38c76d-d54c-436c-8b9f-4c2703648d64\",\n    \"sessionId\": \"c295ea44-7543-4f78-b524-7a38915ad6e4\",\n    \"message\": {\n      \"role\":\"user\",\n      \"parts\": [{\n        \"type\":\"text\",\n        \"text\": \"write a long paper describing the attached pictures\"\n      },{\n        \"type\":\"file\",\n        \"file\": {\n           \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n           \"data\":\"<base64-encoded-content>\"\n        }\n      }]\n    },\n    \"metadata\": {}\n  }\n}\n\n<snip status update...>\n\ndata: {\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"id\": 1,    \n    \"artifact\": [\n      \"parts\": [\n        {\"type\":\"text\", \"text\": \"<section 1...>\"}\n      ],\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"append\": false,      \n      \"lastChunk\": false\n    ]\n  }\n}\n<snip>\n```\n\nNote that the `id` returned in all the TaskArtifactUpdateEvents in that example is 1. I wondered if maybe the ID actually is an Artifact id, but it also seems like that's maybe what `index` is for. \n\nMy guess here is that this is an error, and that the id inside the result field has gotten confused with the JSON-RPC id of 1.\n\nAssuming that `id` in TaskArtifactUpdateEvents is the task ID, my suggestions would be:\n* Either rename the field to `taskId` or add a comment like `// task ID for this artifact`\n* Change the example code in Streaming Support to have `id` be the task ID sent in the request."

In this pattern, it makes sense to use a2a protocol to communicate among the agents.\n2. Inter agency interaction : In this pattern, one or more agents within a orchestration may need some additional context from a 3rd party agent(many be on salesforce) or from another agency. In this situation, I think it makes more sense to use the agent as a tool and leverage MCP to get the context from the 3rd party agents. \n\nI would like to hear other's opinion on this. if this is acceptable, may be we can change the documentation accordingly."

It enables clients to register, list, update, and delete schedules **without** relying on external cron infrastructure.\r\n\r\nEach schedule automatically triggers the existing `tasks/send` engine at configured times, with support for optional timezone settings and start/end bounds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, the A2A protocol only supports one-off task submissions (`tasks/send`) and real-time updates. Many integrations, however, require **built-in scheduling** — e.g., “run this job every night at 2 AM UTC” — without having to manage separate cron systems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What’s Changed\r\n\r\n### 1. New RPC Namespace\r\n\r\nNew methods have been added under `tasks/schedule/`:\r\n\r\n- `tasks/schedule/create`\r\n- `tasks/schedule/list`\r\n- `tasks/schedule/update`\r\n- `tasks/schedule/delete`\r\n\r\n### 2. Cron-Style Scheduling Parameters\r\n\r\nEach scheduled task supports:\r\n\r\n- A cron expression (standard 5- or 6-field format)\r\n- Optional [IANA timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (default: UTC)\r\n- Optional `startTime` and `endTime` bounds\r\n\r\n### 3. Payload Reuse\r\n\r\n- The task payload for a schedule is the same as the existing `TaskSendParams`:\r\n  - `id`, `sessionId`, `message` parts, `pushNotification`, etc.\r\n- When a schedule fires, the server generates a standard A2A `tasks/send` request using the provided payload.\r\n\r\n### 4. JSON Schema Additions\r\n\r\nNew types added under `\"$defs\"` in `specification/json/a2a.json`:\r\n\r\n- `ScheduledTask` (includes `id`, `cron`, and `TaskSendParams`)\r\n- `ScheduledTaskCreateParams`\r\n- `ScheduledTaskUpdateParams`\r\n- `ScheduledTaskListParams`\r\n- `ScheduledTaskIdParams`\r\n- Plus corresponding request/response objects for each new RPC method\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nCreate a nightly “heartbeat” job at 02:00 UTC:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": \"1\",\r\n  \"method\": \"tasks/schedule/create\",\r\n  \"params\": {\r\n    \"schedule\": \"0 2 * * *\",\r\n    \"task\": {\r\n      \"sessionId\": \"sys-health\",\r\n      \"message\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"ping\" }],\r\n      \"pushNotification\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"https://hooks.slack.com/...\",\r\n        \"token\": \"secret\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n"

So, I cloned the `main` branch into a new location (with no preexisting `.venv`'s) and after running `uv sync` noticed that `uv.lock` was out of sync and the \"a2a-samples\" dependency was missing in `hosts/cli` and `hosts/multiagent`. While the `multiagent` still worked from `demo/ui` because `demo/ui` directly requires \"a2a-samples,\" the CLI client did not.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the CLI client works as expected.\r\n\r\n### uv version:\r\n\r\n* uv 0.6.14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRefs: basically, this is a follow-up to PR #182"

There's no way to associate messages or artifacts with specific sessionIds but there would be a session ID in `get` response."

This can be done with minimal changes to the current code base by moving dependencies to `pyproject.toml` definitions in the respective sub-projects, e.g., `agents/langgraph/pyproject.toml`.\n\nDoing this would:\n* help reduce bloating dependency trees of new agent projects (both in a2a-samples and external);\n* and help establish better patterns for adding new agent examples to this repository.\n\n## Relevant issues and PRs\n\n* [PR #149](https://github.com/google/A2A/pull/149#pullrequestreview-2769116396)"

        "body": "I've originally authored an issue in MCP describing this problem [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/333).\n\nI think A2A should also consider the impact of the issue and account for it. For context here's a copy of the issue over there:\n\n>This issue is to discuss the handling of the [confused deputy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem) and determine what makes the most sense for handling this.\n> \n> Under the current design being discussed in https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/205 and the subsequent PR https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/284 there's a simplified assumption being made of the MCP client. In the case of most agents, they won't be granted the full set of authorization scopes typically granted to the user's client (aka the browser). Instead, we should expect that it will be common that an agent will be granted a subset of authorization scopes specifically for performing a task.\n> \n> In this case, an agent (or it's child-agents) will perform separated tasks on behalf of the user and if we re-use the token that's intended for the client it will produce a confused deputy problem. To address this issue, the resource server needs to be able to identify the client and it's agents as independent entities with separated authorization scopes in order to adhere with the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).\n>\n>---\n>\n>There are two ways that I can think of solving this:\n>\n>\n> ### 1. child-agent issuance protocol\n>\n>In this design choice, a client/agent submits a token to the authorization server to get issued a secondary token it can grant to the child-agent to operate on its own behalf. The agent/child-agent would then present this token to the resource server.\n>\n> ### 2. Delegation chains using DPoP\n>\n> In this design choice, we instead rely on delegation chains where a client can take a subject key from a DPoP architecture (such as [DBSC](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-dbsc)) and issue a secondary token with a subset of the authorization scopes. Then, when the agent/child-agent submits a request to the resource server (MCP server), the resource server would validate the delegation chain by verifying the token issued to the client and the token issued to the agent by the client's DPoP subject key.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> My personal preference is towards option 2 as it produces a more scalable approach by reducing the amount of requests necessary. Additionally, it allows for the ability of agents to spawn child-agents and handle authorization without coordination with the authorization server each time this occurs. However, this does rely on further changes to clients and the resource server (MCP server) in order to handle this which aren't as simple as option 1.\n> \n> Luckily we're pretty well heading in that direction already with [DBSC](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-dbsc) in the client, and would just need to add a delegate functionality to make this work. On the resource server side though, we'd also need to handle the more advanced verification logic and that's what I'd like to propose as an enhancement to this spec.\n"

        "body": "## Summary\n\nWe propose the introduction of a standard for Agent2Agent financial transactions for the purposes of monetizing agents and their data. The A2A specification implies a broad discovery mechanism driven by the AgentCard. We anticipate that some payment negotiation will have to take place for commercialized agents during this discovery process and propose adding an extension point for this purpose.\n\n\n## Background\n\n* A2A implies an Agent discovery mechanism\n  \n  The AgentCard advertises the agent’s capabilities, available transports and connection details. We assume a large agent ecosystem will emerge, with some mechanism for agents to connect to other agents autonomously or semi-autonomously. This has some widespread implications for security etc, but we also foresee a need for a similar autonomous or semi-autonomous monetization negotiation for commercialized agents, as both consumers and sellers within an agentic market.\n\n\n* Existing IAM standards and frameworks\n  \n  It is possible within existing IAM standards to autonomously open secure communications between systems, including delegated auth, using e.g OIDC Connect Dynamic Client Registration. While these standards allow agents to act on behalf of a user with an existing billing relationship with a service provider they do not make associated costs clear to the user, or allow for agents to transact without the presence of a user.\n\n\n* Agents need to transact directly with other Agents\n  \n  We anticipate the emergence of an agentic market in which agents transact directly with each other for goods (e.g data, resources) and services (e.g tasks). Without a clear way of specifying the payment required for goods or services and how to transact within the AgentCard, commercialized agents are effectively prevented from taking advantage of the potential discovery mechanisms within A2A\n\n## Proposal\n\nWork toward an RFC for a payment discovery mechanism included within or linked to from the AgentCard. \n\nThis should aim to:\n\n* Allow Agents to advertise the associated cost with each of their capabilities.\n  \n  Cost/Price is likely to be complex and based on different factors for different agents. Informing consuming agents what the likely charge for interaction is will be important for trust and cost control within an agentic market.\n\n\n* Allow Agents to semi-autonomously open a billing relationship with each other by directing agents to other resources, in a similar fashion to OIDC.\n  \n\n* Allow for Agents to make decisions about which Agents they wish to transact with\n  \nThis could take the form of adding a `payment_details` field or similar to the AgentCard, allowing agents to declare their monetization details in the same way they current declare details of e.g notifications. \n\n```\nmessage PaymentDetails {\n  // Indicates if the agent requires payment for access to its skills/data\n  // true: Payment is required\n  // false: The agent provides its skills/data free of charge\n  bool payment_required = 1;\n\n  // URL for initiating payment negotiations\n  // Note: The specifics of the payment negotiation process \n  // are beyond the scope of this specification and should be built upon consensus\n  // from the broader payments provider community\n  string payment_url = 2;\n} \n```\n\n## Additional Context\n\nOur team at Supertab has already been actively working on similar solutions for MCP servers, specifically around enabling low-friction microtransactions at scale. Given that our core focus revolves around aggregating microtransactions into simple billing events, we believe our experience can be valuable in collaborating on and contributing to the RFC process, particularly around standardizing payment interactions for agents. \n\n\n"

Advanced agentic collaboration requires sharing and accessing dynamic operational knowledge in a safe and verifiable way. This extension defines standardized methods for KG query, update, and subscription, providing enhanced protocol-level reasoning, alignment, and multi-agent understanding functionality. It prominently features support for GraphQL as the primary query language.\r\n\r\nA secondary objective of the extension is enabling **A2A** protocol compliance with major security and AI frameworks such as the **EU AI Act**, **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** (**RMF**), **ISO/IEC** standards (including **42001** for **AI Management Systems** and **23894** for **AI Risk Management**), and ethical guidelines like the **Australian AI Ethics Framework**, by providing standardized mechanisms for auditability, provenance tracking, capability declaration, and verifiable knowledge updates.\r\n\r\nA complete analysis of the system's compliance parameters can be found in the guide here:\r\n- [A2A COMPLIANCE GUIDE (WIP)](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/A2A/blob/main/A2A_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Client-Server Conceptual Flow\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    participant ClientAgent as Agent A (Client)\r\n    participant ServerAgent as Agent B (Server w/ KG)\r\n\r\n    ClientAgent->>+ServerAgent: knowledge/query (GraphQL Query)\r\n    ServerAgent->>-ClientAgent: knowledge/query Response (GraphQL Result)\r\n\r\n    ClientAgent->>+ServerAgent: knowledge/update (KG Patches, Justification)\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ServerAgent: Verify Patches (Alignment Check)\r\n    ServerAgent->>-ClientAgent: knowledge/update Response (Success/Fail, Verification Status)\r\n\r\n    ClientAgent->>+ServerAgent: knowledge/subscribe (GraphQL Subscription)\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ServerAgent: Establish Subscription\r\n    Note over ServerAgent: KG Change Occurs\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ClientAgent: SSE Stream: KnowledgeSubscriptionEvent (Change Data)\r\n    ServerAgent-->>ClientAgent: SSE Stream: ...

`KGSubject`, `KGPredicate`, `KGObject`, `KGStatement`, `PatchOperationType`, `KnowledgeGraphPatch`.\r\n    *   Added parameter models: `KnowledgeQueryParams`, `KnowledgeUpdateParams`, `KnowledgeSubscribeParams`.\r\n    *   Added request models: `KnowledgeQueryRequest`, `KnowledgeUpdateRequest`, `KnowledgeSubscribeRequest`.\r\n    *   Added response/result models: `KnowledgeQueryResponse`, `KnowledgeQueryResponseResult`, `KnowledgeUpdateResponse`, `KnowledgeUpdateResponseResult`.\r\n    *   Added streaming event models: `KnowledgeGraphChangeEvent`, `KnowledgeSubscriptionEvent`.\r\n    *   Added new error types: `KnowledgeQueryError`, `KnowledgeUpdateError`, `KnowledgeSubscriptionError`, `AlignmentViolationError`.\r\n    *   Updated `A2ARequest` Union type to include new knowledge requests.\r\n    *   Added `knowledgeGraph` and `knowledgeGraphQueryLanguages` to `AgentCapabilities`.\r\n\r\n2.  **`a2a.json`:**\r\n    *   Updated JSON schema to include definitions for all new types, requests, responses, errors, and capabilities listed above.\r\n    *   Ensured schema reflects GraphQL support (`queryLanguage` enum, `variables`, flexible `data` structure in response).\r\n\r\n3.  **`client.py` (`A2AClient`):**\r\n    *   Added new async methods: `knowledge_query`, `knowledge_update`, `knowledge_subscribe`.\r\n    *   `knowledge_subscribe` returns an `AsyncIterable[KnowledgeSubscriptionEvent]` using SSE.\r\n    *   Added capability checks before calling new methods.\r\n\r\n4.  **`server.py` (`A2AServer`):**\r\n    *   Updated `_process_request` to route new `knowledge/*` methods based on `AgentCapabilities`.\r\n    *   Added specific error handling for `MethodNotFoundError` if capabilities are missing.\r\n    *   Updated `A2ARequest` validation usage.\r\n    *   SSE stream generation logic in `_create_response` now handles `KnowledgeSubscriptionEvent` responses.\r\n\r\n5.  **`task_manager.py` (`TaskManager`, `InMemoryTaskManager`):**\r\n    *   Added abstract method signatures for `on_knowledge_query`, `on_knowledge_update`, `on_knowledge_subscribe` to the `TaskManager` ABC.\r\n    *   Provided placeholder implementations in `InMemoryTaskManager` that return `UnsupportedOperationError`. *(Note: Real implementation requires KG/GraphQL backend)*.\r\n    *   Added placeholder for `knowledge_sse_subscribers` dictionary.\r\n\r\n**Key Features Implemented:**\r\n\r\n*   Protocol definition for KG Query, Update, and Subscription methods.\r\n*   Explicit support for GraphQL (`queryLanguage`, `variables`).\r\n*   Standardized data models for KG statements and patches.\r\n*   Incorporation of specialized safety and compliance concepts: `certainty`, `provenance`, `justification`, `verificationStatus`, `metadata` fields.\r\n*   Capability flags (`knowledgeGraph`, `knowledgeGraphQueryLanguages`) in `AgentCard`.\r\n*   Client methods for utilizing the new features.\r\n*   Server routing and basic capability checks for new methods.\r\n*   Updated JSON Schema specification.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Notes:**\r\n\r\n*   The server-side logic in `InMemoryTaskManager` for handling the actual KG operations and GraphQL execution is **not implemented** in this PR (placeholders returning `UnsupportedOperationError`). A concrete agent implementation will need to provide this using appropriate backend libraries (e.g., RDFLib + Ariadne).\r\n*   Subscription management (tracking subscribers, matching changes to queries) is also part of the backend implementation left for concrete agents.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*   Added/updated unit tests for new types in `common/types.py`.\r\n*   Added basic unit tests for new `A2AClient` methods (checking request formation).\r\n*   Added basic tests for `A2AServer` routing of new methods (checking capability errors and routing to manager stubs).\r\n*   *TODO:* Integration tests require a mock or real agent implementation with KG/GraphQL capabilities.\r\n\r\n**Reviewer Guidance:**\r\n\r\n*   Please review the API design of the new methods (`knowledge/*`).\r\n*   Check the correctness and completeness of the new Pydantic types and the JSON schema (`a2a.json`).\r\n*   Verify the client method implementations and server routing logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 🚀 Enhancing A2A: Knowledge Graph Collaboration\r\n\r\n## The Need for Structured Knowledge\r\n\r\nWhile the base A2A protocol excels at task-based communication, complex AI collaboration requires a deeper, shared understanding of the world – entities, concepts, relationships, and processes. Knowledge Graphs offer a flexible and powerful way to represent this structured information. This extension provides the standard mechanisms for agents to leverage KGs within the A2A framework.\r\n\r\n## Core Features\r\n\r\nThis extension introduces a new `knowledge/` namespace with methods that allow agents to:\r\n\r\n1.  ❓ **Query Knowledge (`knowledge/query`)**\r\n    *   Ask questions of another agent's KG using standardized query languages.\r\n    *   **GraphQL First:** Explicit support for **GraphQL** queries and variables.\r\n    *   *Example:* \"Find all tasks assigned to 'agent-x' that are currently 'working'.\"\r\n\r\n2.  ✍️ **Update Knowledge (`knowledge/update`)**\r\n    *   Propose additions or removals of specific facts (statements/triples) to another agent's KG.\r\n    *   Includes fields for `justification` and `sourceAgentId` for provenance and auditability.\r\n    *   Receiving agent verifies updates against its internal rules and alignment constraints.\r\n    *   *Example:* \"Add the fact that 'task-123' has produced 'artifact-abc'.\"\r\n\r\n3.  🔔 **Subscribe to Knowledge Changes (`knowledge/subscribe`)**\r\n    *   Receive real-time notifications (via Server-Sent Events) when specific parts of an agent's KG change.\r\n    *   Uses **GraphQL Subscriptions** to define the data of interest.\r\n    *   *Example:* \"Notify me whenever the status of any task associated with 'project-alpha' changes.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Reasoning, Safety & Compliance\r\n\r\n*   **Cognitive Mapping & Symbolic Reasoning:** Can directly represent the symbolic relationships modeled in knowledge bases, cognitive maps, and structured / discrete spaces.\r\n*   **Multi-Agent Reasoning:** Provides the foundation for shared understanding needed for complex collaborative reasoning.  \r\n*   **Secure Collaboration:** `metadata` fields allow secure context passing; update verification enforces rules.\r\n*   **Alignment & Auditability:** `provenance`, `certainty`, `justification`, and `verificationStatus` fields support verifiable and aligned AI behavior.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n*   **Richer Agent Interaction:** Moves beyond simple tasking to deep knowledge sharing.\r\n*   **Improved Contextual Awareness:** Agents can query for relevant background information.\r\n*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Enables joint knowledge base construction and maintenance.\r\n*   **Standardization:** Provides a common protocol layer for diverse KG backends and GraphQL engines.\r\n*   **Foundation for Advanced Machine Intelligence:** Supports capabilities like shared understanding, complex reasoning, and verifiable alignment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n- [x] Updating the TS/JS (web) sample server and client.\r\n- [ ] Creating a sample Python agent (TBD).\r\n- [ ] Creating a sample web agent (TBD).\r\n- [ ] Updating the demo UI with a knowledge-sharing workflow (TBD).\r\n- Implementing agents will require integrating KG storage (e.g., RDFLib, GraphDB, Neo4j) and a GraphQL engine (e.g., Ariadne, Graphene) into the A2A server implementation.\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n- [KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EXTENSION README](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/A2A/blob/main/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_EXTENSION.md)\r\n- [COMPLIANCE GUIDE (WIP)](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/A2A/blob/main/A2A_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md)\r\n\r\n---\r\n"

And the remote agent implementing A2A is not a real agent backed by a LLM, instead, is a plain normal http server implementing tool calls (like a mcp server)\n\n```\n\"parts\": [{\n        \"type\":\"text\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"tool\": \"get tickets\",\n            \"args: \"{\\\"owner_id\\\": 123}\"\n        }\n...\n```\n( `metadata` is referenced from https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=structured-output)\n\n**So why doing this?** \n- A2A is more friendly for long running tasks. MCP has no guarantee for long running task when using http transport. For example, A 10 mins sync request is terrible. MCP also doesn't support streaming the result.\n- Unify tools and agents communication in one protocol. This is convenient for dev and maintaining. Also, putting everything together may spark more creativity or interesting interactions.\n"

Similarly to A2A it provides cross agentic framework capabilities so what I am thinking is we could add an option for people using MCPAdapt with an adapter on specific agentic framework A to easily spawn a MCP server that would expose that recommended resource.

The `SummarizerAgent` is designed to take a text string as input and return a concise summary of that text.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nThis example provides a clear illustration of how Pydantic AI can be leveraged to create agents and how such agents can be easily integrated into the A2A ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/agent.py`:**\r\n    -   Defines the `SummarizerAgent` class, inheriting from Pydantic's `BaseModel`.\r\n    -   Utilizes Pydantic AI's `@AICallable` decorator to define the `summarize` method, which handles the summarization logic.\r\n    -   Configures the agent to use the OpenAI API key fetched from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.\r\n    -   The summarize function has a string as input, and a string as output.\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/__main__.py`:**\r\n    -   Creates an instance of the `SummarizerAgent`.\r\n    -   Wraps the agent instance in an `A2AAgent` to make it compatible with the A2A protocol.\r\n    -   Starts an `A2AServer` to host the agent and handle incoming A2A requests.\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/README.md`:**\r\n    -   Provides instructions on how to run the agent locally.\r\n    -   Explains how to connect to the agent.\r\n    -   Describes the input and output of the agent.\r\n-   **`samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/__init__.py`**:\r\n    - Empty file, to make the module a python module.\r\n\r\n**How to Run and Test:**\r\n\r\n1.  Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.\r\n2.  Navigate to the `samples/python/agents/pydantic_agent/` directory.\r\n3.  Execute `python __main__.py`.\r\n4.  Find the agent card url printed on the console.\r\n5. Add the agent to the demo UI or any other A2A client.\r\n6. You will be able to interact with the agent, sending texts and getting summaries.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n-   Provides a practical example of using Pydantic AI for agent development.\r\n-   Demonstrates the integration of a Pydantic AI agent with the A2A framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

First with `bind_tools` to get a response that knows about the tools (stored in message history)\r\n2. Then with `with_structured_output` to get a structured response (stored in structured_response)\r\n\r\nThese two responses can be inconsistent, as mentioned in issue google-a2a/a2a-samples#117.

The test confirms that:\r\n\r\n1. The original implementation uses only the structured content, which can be inconsistent with the message history\r\n2. The fixed implementation prioritizes the message content from the message history, which is more likely to be correct\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that the response shown to the user is consistent with the tool usage and reasoning shown in the message history, which is important for a good user experience."

I hope these translations will help more developers discover and understand A2A.\r\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to A2A's development and would love to contribute more in the future.

A2A fills a real gap in the agent ecosystem, and the clarity of the protocol is impressive.\n\nI’ve built a multi-agent orchestration system that’s already functioning as a live cognitive environment...with distinct roles, persistent memory, and internal coordination logic. The core focus is on orchestration, not just communication. Agents operate as a team, with structured handoffs, emergent behavior, and system-level reflection. Would love to connect the two teams if it makes sense.\n\nI’m curious whether the A2A roadmap includes:\n   - Support for persistent agent identity and role fidelity across sessions or ecosystems\n   - Patterns for cross-agent memory references or multi-turn handoffs\n   - Extensions for team-based logic orchestration, beyond bilateral messaging\n\nNot looking to pitch...just genuinely exploring alignment points. If there’s additional architectural guidance beyond what’s in the repo, I’d be grateful for a pointer.\n\nThanks again for putting this into the open. It’s a big step forward"

        "body": "## Summary\nWe propose to enhance the Agent2Agent (A2A) ecosystem by integrating a delegated authentication and authorization mechanism—modeled after approaches like Composio AgentAuth and standard OAuth 2.0—to allow agents to securely act on behalf of users. This middleware enhancement will enable an Agent2Agent server (e.g., an MCP server) to delegate permissions and perform actions only with explicit user consent.\n\n## Background\n- **Need for Delegated Authorization:**  \n  In multi-agent systems such as those utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it is essential that any agent performing actions on a user's behalf is explicitly authorized. Delegated user authorization helps mitigate the significant security risks when a server performs actions without verifying user permissions.\n\n- **Current Limitations:**  \n  While the Agent2Agent specification offers robust mechanisms for agent-to-agent communication, it does not natively implement an advanced delegated authentication mechanism similar to Composio AgentAuth. Instead, it relies on integration with external Identity Provider (IdP) systems (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to authenticate clients.\n\n- **Community Discussions:**  \n  The MCP community has been actively discussing these issues to define a proper specification for secure token delegation:  \n  - [MCP Security Discussion – Issue #205](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/205)  \n  - [MCP Proposed Enhancements – PR #284](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/284/files)\n\n- **Enterprise Authentication Guidelines:**  \n  Google's A2A documentation on authenticating clients in enterprise environments also provides guidance on securing agent interactions, which can serve as a valuable reference for this enhancement:  \n  - [A2A Enterprise-Ready Authentication](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/enterprise_ready?id=authenticating-clients)\n\n## Proposed Enhancement\nWe propose the development of a middleware extension for Agent2Agent servers that enables delegated user authorization by integrating with external IdP platforms. The key components of this proposal include:\n\n### 1. External IdP Integration\n- **Objective:**  \n  Integrate with external Identity Provider platforms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to obtain and validate user-specific access tokens.  \n  **Note:** While Agent2Agent does not currently support a mechanism like Composio AgentAuth directly, using it as a model can help illustrate the desired behavior.\n  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Modify agent-to-agent requests to include an optional authentication header or token field.\n  - Ensure these tokens are obtained from a trusted IdP and are validated on each request.\n\n### 2. Delegated Authorization Mechanism\n- **Objective:**  \n  Enable agents to operate under the explicit permissions of a user.\n  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Extend the A2A messaging schema with support for delegated token propagation.\n  - Establish middleware to intercept and validate tokens, ensuring that every action performed by an agent is carried out on behalf of an authenticated user.\n  - Leverage ideas from Composio AgentAuth to illustrate a secure flow of authentication data and token propagation.\n\n### 3. Security and Auditability\n- **Objective:**  \n  Secure the authorization process and ensure transparency for all delegated actions.\n  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Log all authentication and token validation events.\n  - Provide mechanisms for token revocation and generate audit trails for any actions carried out using delegated permissions.\n  - Utilize standard security practices to verify token integrity and expiration.\n\n### 4. Backward Compatibility and Configurability\n- **Objective:**  \n  Ensure that existing Agent2Agent deployments are not disrupted.\n  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Offer the delegated authorization feature as an optional module or configurable setting.\n  - Maintain backward compatibility by allowing agents that do not require this feature to continue operating as usual.\n\n## Benefits\n- **Enhanced Security:**  \n  Agents can only act with explicit user consent, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized actions.\n\n- **Interoperability:**  \n  Standardizing on external IdP integrations (using OAuth 2.0/Composio AgentAuth as a model) will provide a consistent, secure method for delegated authorization across diverse systems.\n\n- **Future-Proofing:**  \n  This enhancement aligns with the evolving security requirements for multi-agent systems, ensuring robust authentication and authorization in complex environments such as MCP.\n\n## References\n- [A2A Enterprise-Ready Authentication Guidelines](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/enterprise_ready?id=authenticating-clients)\n- [MCP Security Discussion – Issue #205](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/205)\n- [MCP Proposed Enhancements – PR #284](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/284/files)\n- [Composio AgentAuth Overview](https://composio.dev/agentauth/)\n\n## Conclusion\nBy integrating an external IdP-based delegated authorization mechanism into Agent2Agent servers, we can ensure that agents operate strictly under the permissions granted by users. This feature will significantly enhance security in multi-agent systems such as MCP servers, making it easier and safer for agents to act on behalf of users."
